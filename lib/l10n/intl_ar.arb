And to substitute man made laws in place of the Sharī'ah from Allāh? This is what they do without a doubt. And the one who assists them, regardless of whether he intended these objectives [of the Kuffār] or not, he has fulfilled their needs, and whoever fulfils the needs of the Mushrikeen by Shirk for their Shirk [to prevail], and has fulfilled the demands of the Imāms of Kufr for their Kufr [to prevail], and assisted the people of Kufr to succeed in substituting man-made laws in the place of the Sharī'ah from Allāh, then the one who does this is from the greatest of Mushrikeen, and from the greatest Imāms of Kufr.",

  "charityA1Par1": "Shaykh Sulaymān ibn Nāsir al-'Alwān(حفظه الله) was asked: A dispute has occurred between some of the brothers regarding the ruling of paying the Zakāt in money instead of Food. And everyone had his own opinion from an Islamic point of view, so I'll summarise it for you quickly: ",
  "charityA1Par2": "The first person says: It is prohibited to pay the Zakāt al-Fitra in Money because it goes against what the Prophet(ﷺ) did.\nThe second person says: It is preferred to pay [Zakāt al-Fitr] in Food, and paying it with money is permissible, however it is in opposition to the Sunnâh. The third person says: It's preferred to look at the situation of the poor person & the situation of his country and its environment, because money might be better for him. ",
  "charityA1Par3": "So my question O respected Shaykh: Did any of the Salaf give a Fatwa to pay [Zakāt al-Fitr] with money instead of Food? And is it better for someone to pay [Zakāt al-Fitr] with money because the needy prefers that? Shaykh Sulaymān ibn Nāsir al-'Alwān(حفظه الله) responded by saying: This issue is one of the differed upon matters, and the Imāms of the Salaf differ regarding paying Zakāt al-Fitr with Money. And saying this opinion or that opinion is more correct is a matter of Ijtihād, so no one should call the other person misguided or an innovator. And the principle regarding the differences of opinion in the likes of this issue, is that it should not break the friendship & love between the disputers, nor to have fury in their hearts, for all of them are good, and there's no blame upon someone who concludes with [an opinion] of what he hears. ",
  "charityA1Par4": "And many of the Imāms would say in their speech regarding the differed upon matters \"Our statements are correct, while it could contain mistakes, and the statements of others are mistaken, but it could contain the truth\" And the Majority of the Imāms have gone to say that it's not permissible to take out Money for Zakāt al-Fitr, Imām Ahmad(رحمه الله) said: \"I fear that it won't suffice, it's in opposition to the Sunnâh of the Messenger of Allâh(ﷺ), and this is the Madhab of Mālik (رحمه الله) and al-Shāfi'ī(رحمه الله). And al-Imām Ibn Hazm(رحمه الله) said: \"Money does not suffice in any case to begin with, because that is not what the Messenger of Allâh(ﷺ) has mandated\" ",
  "charityA1Par5": "And 'Attā'(رحمه الله), al-Hassan al-Basrī(رحمه الله), 'Omar ibn 'Abdûl 'Azīz(رحمه الله), al-Thawrī(رحمه الله), Abū Hanīfah(رحمه الله) and others have gone towards the permissibility of paying [Zakāt al-Fitr] with Money instead of Food, Abū Ishāq al-Sabī'ī [who is one of the\nImāms of the Tābi'īn] said: \"I have seen them pay the Sadaqah in Ramadān with Darāhim [Money] in its [equivalent] value for food\" narrated by Imām ibn Abī Shaybah(رحمه الله) in al-Musannâf. ",
  "charityA1Par6": "And the proof for that is:\n1 - Is that there's no text proven from the Prophet(ﷺ) nor any of the Sahābah regarding the impermissibility of paying [Zakāt al-Fitr] with Money, and the reported Ahādith within the text mentioning a specific types of Food doesn't mean what's apart from it is forbidden [to give in Zakāt] ",
  "charityA1Par7": "2 - The proof for this is that the Sahābah, may Allâh(سبحانه وتعالى) be pleased with them, permitted taking out wheat [Which is not specified by the text] instead of barley, dates and similar to that from the different kinds that are narrated in the Authentic Ahādīth. Infact, many of the Sahābah, rather most of them, during the era of Mu'āwiyah(رضى الله عنه) went towards the permissibility of giving out half a Sā' [2.5-3.0 kg's] from the Sumrā'[Brown wheat] of al-Shām instead of a Sā' [2.5-3.0 kg's] of dates, so this is a proof that they saw half a Sā' is equal to the price of a Sā' of dates or barley and similar to that. ",
  "charityA1Par8": "3 - Also with proof that the purpose behind Zakāt is enrichment of the poor, and money is more beneficial for some of them instead of Food, so in that case, you would check to see the situation of the poor in every country. ",
  "charityA1Par9": "4 - Also with proof that many of the needy take the Food and sells it on the same day or the next day below its actual price, so who would benefit more, the one that was given Food, or the one who was given the Money equivalent to the value of this Sā' [2.5-3.0 kg's], and Allâh (سبحانه وتعالى) knows best.",
  "charityA2Par1": "Allāh the Almighty said: \n{charityAya}\n\"Zakāh is only for the poor and the needy, for those employed to administer it, for those whose hearts are attracted ˹to the faith˺, for ˹freeing˺ slaves, for those in debt, for Allāh’s cause, and for ˹needy˺ travellers. ˹This is˺ an obligation from Allāh. And Allāh is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\"\n[Sūrah At-Tawbah 60]\nThese are the eight categories of people who deserve Zakāh, so you should distribute it to them yourself, may Allāh grant you Tawfīq. ",
  "charityA2Par2": "1 & 2: The faqeer and miskeen are well-known; the faqeer (poor) being the destitute (who has nothing), while the miskeen (needy) is someone who doesn't have enough to cover his needs.",
  "charityA2Par3": "3: Those employed to administer Zakāh. This refers to the workers who are employed to collect and distribute Zakāh and play a role in that (i.e. their wages are taken from the Zakāh). ",
  "charityA2Par4": "4: for ˹freeing˺ slaves. \nThis refers to emancipation of slaves - and not as some people assume, that it includes paying off the blood money for killers or bailing someone out of prison; these are not included in this category.\n5: for those whose hearts are attracted ˹to the faith ",
  "charityA2Par5": "Al-ghārimīn (for those in debt). This refers to those people who bear a heavy financial debt, whether they took this debt in the interest of reconciling between people, or for their own personal interest or for in the interest of the public. If someone has a debt, he should be given from Zakāh. ",
  "charityA2Par6": "7: fī sabīli-llāh (for Allāh’s cause). This refers to the mujahideen; those who fight in the path of Allāh.\n8: Ibnus-Sabīl (the needy traveller) is someone who is cut off in a far off land and is financially unable to return back to his country.\nSo look for one of these categories of people and pay your Zakāh to them. ",
  "charityA3Par1": "When the Muslim gives charity and includes in his intention someone else along with himself like his parents or anyone else, it doesn’t matter how many people, they don’t all share the reward rather each one get the same reward with no decrease from the other.",
  "charityA3Par2": "When you share it means you give some away and take some. But on the contrary, they get the same reward you get, there is no decrease from you or them.",
  "charityA3Par3": "There are so many ahadith of the Prophet(ﷺ) to indicate this. You get the same thing, full reward and they get the same thing, full reward. No sharing. No decrease from the one who donated it.\n\nAllah, the Most Generous’ generosity is beyond belief! ",

  "deathA2Par3": "And the second opinion is: its permissibility, and they said: “reciting the Quran and dedicating its reward to a living or dead person will reach the one to whom it is dedicated.” And this is the opinion of many of the scholars and this is the opinion of the Hanbali's and the Hanafi's and many of the later scholars, and it is the strongest opinion, In-sha-Allahu-ta`ala.",

  "eatingNotesPar1": "1. The meat of Ahlâl Kitāb is permissible by Ijmā', the Qur'ān & Sunnâh is absolutely clear regarding this matter.\n2. By principle, meat is Halāl unless proven otherwise, according to the Ijmā' of the Sahābah & Salaf as mentioned by Imām ibn Taymiyyâh(رحمه الله) in the 21 st volume of al-Fatawah, rather differences occurred in the middle centuries where they said it’s Haram by principle.\n3. Say, \"I do not find within that which was revealed to me [anything] forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine - for indeed, it is impure - or it be [that slaughtered in] disobedience, dedicated to other than Allah . But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], then indeed, your Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.\" [6:145] ",
  "eatingNotesPar2": "Allāh(وعال )جال says \"I do not find within that which was revealed to me [anything] forbidden to one\" meaning there's nothing Harām, except what has been mentioned in this verse, and this is clear that Meat is Halāl by default and there's no disagreement among the Sahābah concerning this.\nLikewise, the Hadith of the Prophet where he prohibited the meat of domestic donkeys at Khaybar, what is understood from this is that domestic donkeys was permissible by default, until a prohibition came to forbid that. \nAlso as al-Zuhrī(رحمه الله) said \"Allāh made the people of the scriptures meat lawful, while knowing what they will Say and Do, so do not ask about that\", so we accept the slaughter of the christians without asking any question.",
  "eatingNotesPar3": "4. The slaughter must be from Ahlâl Kitāb, even if he doesn't completely follow the bible or torah, as long as he believes in his scriptures and is not an atheist or agnostic, he is considered from among the people of the book.\n5. There's no need to ask \"Did they say bismillâh or not\" because the Prophet(وسلم عليه هللا )صلى ate from the meat of Khaybar without asking them \"Did you say Bismillâh\", by principle Allâh(وعال )جل has made it halāl.",
  "eatingNotesPar4": "6. There's a difference of opinion whether the meat must be hand slaughtered, Imām Abū Hanīfah(رحمه الله), Imām Al-Shāfi'ī(رحمه الله), Imām Ahmad ibn Hanbal(رحمه الله) and the majority of the scholars say \"It's compulsory for the meat to be hand-slaughtered\"\n7. If you live in a country mixed with Ahlâl Kitāb & Mushrikeen and you're not sure whether it was slaughtered by either, it returns back to the principle of the meat, which is Halāl.\n\n8.

  "enteringMosquePar1": "Shaykh Sulayman al-‘Alwan said: There are three different opinions regarding the issue of a women in her menses entering the Mosque:\n1. It's not permissible for her to enter the mosque, and this is what's most known from the Madhab of Imām Mālik and al-Shāfi'ī, and the لرأي (أهلHanafī's), and one of the sayings in the madhab of Imām Ahmad, and they used as evidence the prophet's saying \"I do not permit the menstrator or junb(post sexual state) to be in the mosque\" and the prophets saying to Ai'sha(عنها هللا )رضي \"perform what a pilgrim does, except that you don't do Tawāf\" and the hadīth is agreed upon its authenticity, and they used as proof that the Prophet(وسلم عليه هللا )صلى \"Prevented the menstrator to be present at the Eīd prayer\" and the hadīth is agreed upon its authenticity.",
  "enteringMosquePar2": "2. It's permissible to enter the mosque for a need and a necessity, and this was chosen by Shaykh al-Islām ibn taymiyyāh(رحمه الله) with proof that the prophet(وسلم عليه هللا )صلى \"placed a tent(covering) for the black woman\" which was narrated by Al-Bukhārī, and the scholars have said, this woman must've been menstrating, and the prophet( هللا صلى وسلم )عليه did not prevent placing a covering for her in the mosque, and we can derive from this that the menstrator can attend gatherings and studies of knowledge and other than it.",
  "enteringMosquePar3": "3. It's permissible to enter the mosque as long as she abstains staining the floor, and this is the Madhab spoken from Mālik and one of the 2 sayings in the Shāfi'ī madhab, and Ahmad, and this is the saying of the Dhāhiriyyāh, chosen by ibn hazm(رحمه الله), and it has strength with the proof of the saying of prophet( وسلم يه عل هللا صلي ) to Ai'sha( هللا رضي عنه ) \"Get me the mat from the mosque.' She said: 'I am menstruating.' He said: 'Your menstruation is not in your hands.\" narrated by Imām Muslim( هللا رحمه ), and these scholars use the proof of الصلية لبراءة \"Original disassociation\"[Permissible until proven Prohibited by an Authentic Text] in that there is not a single authentic hadīth\nwhich proves it's not allowed, and the reply to the narration \"I do not permit the menstrator or junb(post sexual state) to be in the mosque\" is a report which isn't authentic, it was narrated by Abu Dawud(232) and Ibn Khuzaymah(2/284) from different authoritites from ‘Abdul Waahid ibn Ziyad from Aflat ibn Khaleefah, he said Jusrah bint Dajajah informed me, from ‘Aisha.",

And my answer to the hadīth of 'Ā'isha[not allowed to make tawāf] is that this is reported about Tawāf and has nothing to do with entering the mosque, and this is apparent. And my answer to the prevention of the Prophet(وسلم عليه هللا )صلى for the menstrator to move away from the musallāh of the muslims, the musallāh meaning the place people pray in and not the actual mosque, so the menstrator would be far away from the Musallāh that people are praying in, so that the praying women don't get disturbed and cause problems for them, or similar to it, and Allah(وتعالى )سبحانه knows best.",

  "fastA1par1": "The Scholars have agreed that whoever swallows his own saliva, his fast is not broken, because saliva comes from the mouth, so it doesn't affect the person fasting to swallow it. ",
  "fastA1par2": "And is it considered disliked to do that or not? What's correct is that it's not disliked if he didn't purposely gather his saliva, because the precautions that come with it are difficult and burdensome and it's not possible for anyone to handle that.\nBut as for Phlegm, then a group of Scholars have said that if it's from the chest, it doesn't break the fast, and if it was from the Jawf [The empty space in the mouth and the throat] or the Brain, then it breaks the fast. What's correct is that swallowing Phlegm intentionally is Makrūh [Disliked] or Harām [Prohibited] according to a group of Scholars, except that it doesn't break the fast in all cases, because it's not food or drink, and it's neither from its implications. ",
  "fastA1par3": "And Phlegm is something that causes distress and the Ummâh is in need of knowing its ruling, so if it broke the fast, the Prophet(ﷺ)  would have clarified that with a general statement, so if there's no report mentioning that, it becomes known that the statement which mentions that it breaks the fast is not correct. ",
  "fastA1par4": "And Imām Ahmad(رحمه الله) said in the Riwāyah of Al-Marwazī(رحمه الله): \"You do not have to make up a day if you swallowed Phlegm while you are fasting\" ",
  "fastA2par1": "The Shaykh(حفظه لله) responded by saying: Sexual Intercourse during the day of Ramadān is among the transgressions against the sanctity of Allâh(سبحا نه وتعالى) and it is Harām by  the Qur'ān, Sunnâh and Ijmā'.",
  "fastA2par2": "And the person who had intercourse must pay a Kafārah [Expiation], which is to free a Slave, if he's not able to do so, then he must fast 2 months in a row, if he's not able to do so, then he must feed 60 poor people, and the proof for this is what Imām al-Bukhārī(1936) and Imām Muslim(1111) narrated from the chain of al-Zuhrī(رحمه الله), he said: I was informed by Humayd ibn 'Abdûl Rahmān(رحمه الله) that Abā Hurayrah(رضي الله عنه ) said : ",
  "fastA2par3": "\"While we were sitting with the Prophet(ﷺ) a man came to him and said O Messenger of Allâh(ﷺ) I am ruined, he(ﷺ) said \"Why are you ruined\", he said \"I have had intercourse with my wife while I was fasting\", so the Messenger of Allâh(ﷺ) said: \"Do you have a slave to set free\", he said No. He(ﷺ) said: \"Then are you able to fast two months in a row\", he said No. So he(ﷺ) said \"Do you have enough to feed 60 poor people\", he said no - The Prophet(ﷺ) stayed silent and while we were in that state, a big basket full of dates was brought to the Prophet(ﷺ). He(ﷺ) asked, \"Where is the questioner?\" he replied, \"I [am here].\" The Prophet(ﷺ) said to him \"Take this [basket of dates] and give it in Sadaqäh.\" The man said, \"Should I give it to a person poorer than me? By Allah, there is no family between its two mountains [of Madīnah] who are poorer than me.\" The Prophet(ﷺ) smiled till his premolar teeth became visible and then said, 'Feed your family with it.\" ",
  "fastA2par4": "And this is the ruling regarding the person who knows and did so intentionally according to the correct view among the sayings of the Scholars.\n\nBecause the one who is Forgetful and Ignorant of the ruling, and the coerced, do not have to make up a day nor pay the Kafārah [Expiation], since Allâh(سبحا نه وتعالى) has raised the blame off this Ummâh and has forgiven mistake & forgetfulness, Allâh(سبحا نه وتعالى) says: Our Lord, do not hold us accountable if we forget or make mistakes and in Sahīh Muslim(126) on the authority of 'Abdullâh ibn 'Abbāsرضي الله عنهما )) from the Prophet(ﷺ) that he said: Allâh(سبحا نه وتعالى) said \"I have already done so\" [i.e. Forgiven the mistakes of this Ummâh].

  "fastA2par5": "And this is the Madhab of Abī Hanīfah(رحمه الله) and al-Shāfi'ī(رحمه الله) regarding the forgetful one, and Ishāq(رحمه الله) & Ahmad(رحمه الله) in a Narration said the Forgetful and Ignorant one is excused, and this was chosen by Shaykh al-Islām ibn Taymiyyâh(رحمه الله) and ibn al-Qayyîm(رحمه الله). Mālik(رحمه الله), Layth ibn Sa'd(رحمه الله) and a group of Scholars have said, he must make up that day without paying the Kafārah [Expiation], and Ahmad ibn Hanbal(رحمه الله) in what's most popular in his Madhab said, he must make up that day and pay the Kafārah [Expiation], whether he had sexual intercourse in the state of Forgetfulness or Ignorance [of the ruling], and this was chosen by Ahläl Dhāhir [The Dhāhiriyyâh]. ",

",
  "fastA3par2": "However the second opinion is much stronger, and that it's permissible to fast the 6 days of Shawwāl in Dhîl Qa'dah if there was a valid excuse, because the Prophet(ﷺ) delayed the 2 rak'ah [which is among the sunan al-Rawātib] after Salāt al-Dhuhr till after Salāt al-'Asr, so likewise a woman who was in the state of Nifās throughout the month of Ramadān has a valid excuse, and Allâh(سبحا نه وتعالى) knows best.

It was narrated by Ibn Abī Shaybah(رحمه الله) in \"al-Musannâf\" from the authority of Wakī' from Ibn 'Awn from Ibn Muhayrīz who said: Ibn Mas'ūd(رضي الله عنه ) said [the Hadīth], and Allāh(سبحا نه وتعالى) knows best ",

So a group of scholars from the Fuqahā' said: \"That the last 10 days of Ramadān is greater\", and a group of scholars said: \"Verily, the first 10 days of Dhil Hijjâh is greater\", and a group of scholars explained it in further detail by saying: \"Verily the 10 'nights' of Ramadān are greater than the 10 nights of Dhil Hijjâh, and the [10] 'days' of Dhil Hijjâh are greater than the [10] days of Ramadān\" and this is the chosen view of Shaykh al-Islām ibn Taymiyyâh(رحمه الله). And this view is questionable, because the Prophet(ﷺ) said and the hadīth is in Bukhārī from the hadīth of ibn 'Abbās(رضي الله عنهما) : \"[And there are no days...(greater than the first 10 of dhil hijjah)]\"",
  "fastA5par2": "And it's generalised as \"al-Yawm\" which includes the night and the day, and what's\nmore correct of being said is: \"Verily the first 10 of Dhil Hijjâh is greater than the last 10 from Ramadān\" and there's no difference between the night & the day, and Laylat ul-Qadr [the night of Power] whenever it occurs is greater than the 10 [Days & Nights!] of Dhil\nHijjâh, therefore this night on its own is greater than the 10 [days & nights] of Dhil Hijjâh & as for the rest of the nights, then they are not(greater).

  "hajjA1par10": "4. And a group of scholars have permitted a woman to travel in all cases if she was with a group of trustworthy women.\n5. And another group of scholars have completed forbidden a woman to travel in all cases, except in what the scholars have agreed upon in the 3 situations mentioned above[if she reverted etc...], and this is the Madhab of Imām Ahmad(رحمه الله), and is more suitable/correlates with the apparent/clear text \"A woman cannot travel except with a Mahrâm\". HOWEVER, if it occurs that the woman travels without a Mahrâm, her Hajj is complete/accepted in Islām. ",
  "hajjA1par11": "Note: The definition of \"travelling\" goes back to the 'Urf(customs) of the time - It's not permissible to use the hadīths \"Travel for 3 days without Mahram\" in today's sense where a person can basically travel the whole world in that specified time period. Rather, whatever is considered \"Travelling in our times\" even if it was 1 hour on a plane etc... is considered harām if it was without a Mahram علم وهللا ",
  "hajjA1par2": "And from this, the majority of the scholars have stated that it's not permissible for a woman to make Hajj except with a Mahram, regardless if her Hajj was compulsory or optional, and regardless if the woman was young or old, and regardless if the travelling distance was long or short. And some of the scholars are of the view that a woman can make Hajj with a group of trustworthy women, infact Imām Mālik(رحمه الله) & al-Shāfi'ee(رحمه الله) said she is compelled to go to Hajj with a group of women, i.e. in the compulsory Hajj, and from al-Shāfi'ee(رحمه الله) is a second saying in the issue \"that the woman goes out(for Hajj) even if she was with one woman that's trustworthy\", and another group of scholars said \"A woman can travel alone if the road was safe\" and this is what ibn Muflih(رحمه الله) mentions from Shaykh al-Islām ibn Taymiyyâh(رحمه الله), ",
  "hajjA1par3": "but what is present in the Fatāwâh(of ibn Taymiyyâh) is that the woman doesn't travel to Hajj, except with friends or Mahrams, so what's clear from this is that Shaykh al-Islām ibn Taymiyyâh(رحمه الله) permits a woman to travel without a Mahram if she was with trustworthy friends i.e. trustworthy women, and the proof of this saying is what is mentioned in Sahīh al-Bukhārî Mu'allâqâ that 'Omar ibn al-Khattâb(رضي الله عنه ) in the final Hajj he made, gave permission to the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) to perform Hajj, so he sent with them 'Uthmân ibn 'Affān( هللا رضي )عنه and 'Abdûl al-Rahmân ibn 'Âwf(رضي الله عنه ), so they(the scholars of this view) said \"this is a consensus of the Sahābah of the permissibility of a woman travelling without a Mahram if she was with trustworthy women and the road was safe\". ",
  "hajjA1par4": "And we could respond against this by saying that the wording of the Prophet(ﷺ) is explicit in this issue \"A woman does not travel except with a Mahrâm\" and this hadīth is Agreed upon [in it's authenticity], and he made his saying a general one, and numerous narrations have been mentioned regarding travelling, so a narration came from Abū Hurayrâh(رضي الله عنه ) in Sahîh Muslîm \"It's not permissible for a woman who believes in Allâh & the last day to go travelling for 3 days or more\" and it's mentioned in Sahîh Muslîm from the Hadīth of Abū Hurayrâh \"one night\" and it's also mentioned in the Sahīhayn [Bukhārī & Muslim] from the Hadith of Abū Hurayrâh(رضي الله عنه ) \"A journey of one day & one night\" and in Sahîh al-Bukhārī from the hadīth of Abî Sa'eed(رضي الله عنه ) \"A journey of two days\" so when these narrations have differences that indicate a specific time, it's compulsory to take the unrestricted meaning [hadīths which mention no time period for the Journey - So it's harām to go travelling without a Mahram fullstop], particularly the hadīth of ibn 'Abbâs(رضي الله عنهما ) which isn't differed upon(in wordings from him). ",
  "hajjA1par5": "In addition to this, the Prophet(ﷺ) stated this in Hajj or in the end of his life, and it's possible that he said it in the 9th year AH in which Abū Bakr(رضي الله عنه ), 'Alī( هللا رضي )عنه and a group of Sahābah made Hajj in, so taking the unrestricted narrations which are explicit in the topic is given preference to taking the restricted narrations [that mention 1,2,3 days etc...] that aren't explicit. Also, even if we take the restricted evidences for argument sake, no doubt Hajj takes more than 3 days, indeed Hajj exceeds more than 3 days, and it's not possible to finish Hajj in less than 3 days, so how can a woman travel this distance which would exceed 5,6 or 7 days and all the narrations do not mention anything above 3 days, rather it mentions three[days], two[days], one day & night, a journey of one day & a journey of one night.

  "hajjA1par6": "Also the reply to the actions of the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) is that this was an Ijtihād(educated guess) from them, and it could also be said that most of the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) had Mahrams, Hafsâ(عنها هللا )رضي in particular & others, except that this might be opposed/rejected for Safiyyâh(عنها هللا )رضي, so it could be said that the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) are unlawful to be married, so it's not possible that anyone would have temptations/desires for them, and neither would they tempt the men, so it's as if their situation is less than others, especially since they made Hajj with 'Abdûl Rahmân ibn 'Âwf(رضي الله عنه ) and with 'Uthmân ibn 'Affān(رضي الله عنه ) and with the Major companions, and they would look after them more than they would look after their own daughters.",
  "hajjA1par7": "In addition to this is that the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) are the mothers of the believers, so these things(going to Hajj without a Mahrâm) could be justifiable for their actions, unlike other than them with the amount of corrupted ones, and perversion in the society, and Fitan(temptations), and being subjected to aggressors/attackers, and this is in particular with the presence of an explicit text \"A woman cannot travel except with a Mahrâm\", however what must be payed attention to, is that whoever permitted a woman to travel with trustworthy women in Hajj & 'Umrâh, do not permit this in every situation, and isn't permitted in every travel. What has been permitted from these Scholars is restricted to certain circumstances: ",
  "hajjA1par8": "1. A kāfirah(disbeliever) that reverts to Islām in dār al-Harb, it's permissible for her to travel alone to the land of the muslims.\n2. A prisoner which is free from the Kuffār, it's permissible for her to travel alone.\n3. If the woman & her friend separate from each other, she can befriend other than her if she was trustworthy/secure, or else she can travel on her own [Till she reaches her destination]. ",
  "hajjA1par9": "And it could also be said that the travelling of a woman without a Mahrâm has situations:\n1. That she travels on her own without the road being safe, then this travelling is harām by consensus, regardless if the travelling was for Hajj or 'Umrâh or for other than that.\n2. That she travels on her own & she is secure/safe on the road, then this is harām according to the Jumhūr [The majority of the Scholars]\n3. That she travels alone with a group of trustworthy women, and this has been permitted by a group of scholars in Hajj and 'Umrâh, and as we have previously stated, it has been mentioned in Bukhārī Mu'allâqa from the chain of Ibrāhīm from his father from his grandfather who said \"Omar ibn al-Khattâb(رضي الله عنه ) in the final Hajj he made, gave permission to the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) to perform Hajj, so he sent with them 'Uthmân ibn 'Affān(رضي الله عنه ) and 'Abdûl al-Rahmân ibn 'Âwf(عنه هللا \")رضي ",
  "hajjA2par1": "The Shaykh responded by saying: There's nothing wrong with that, even if some hairs fall off, Imām Mālik(رحمه الله) has narrated in the Muwattâ' [2/290 - Sharh al-Zarqānī] with an authentic chain from 'įlqimâh ibn Abī 'įlqimâh from his mother that she said \"I heard Ā'isha, the wife of the Prophet(ﷺ) get asked whether a Muhrîm can scratch the body, so she said 'Yes, he can scratch it & do so harshly, even if my hands are tied up & I do not find anything except my feet, I would scratch'...\" ",

And bathing habitat's hairs to fall off, and there has been no statement\nmentioned prohibiting that.\nInfact, it's mentioned in the Sahīhayn [Bukhārī & Muslim] from the chain of 'Attâ' from Tāwûs from ibn 'Abbâs that the Prophet(ﷺ) did cupping while he is Muhrîm.",

But what's correct is that there's nothing upon him, because the Prophet(ﷺ) did not mention in that any Fidyâh and delaying the message from its prescribed/necessary time is not permissible.",
  "hajjA2par4": "However, if the Muhrîm shaves all of his head for an excuse or other than that, then it's compulsory upon him to slaughter a sheep or fast 3 days or feed 6 poor people, for every poor person receives half of 2.5-3KG's[صاع ]نصف and this is from the agreed upon matters\nbetween the scholars.

Don’t lose and then regret you didn’t take full advantage of the opportunity, most importantly do not restrict your duah, nothing is too much or too great for Allah to bestow and grant! This is the time to secure your future, build your hereafter by imploring Him and get forgiven for your past. This is a generous day in which Allah forgives left, right and centre.",
  "hajjSub11Par4": "It is important to note that duah on the day of ‘Arafah is for everything that you want and need, it is not what has been written in the books!\n\nThen after you will offer the Dhur prayer and Asr prayer COMBINED and SHORTENED wherever you stand in ‘Arafah - but make sure you are standing in ‘Arafah and not the outskirts. The prophet said ‘any place in ‘Arafah your ritual’s accepted.’\n\nThe prophet(ﷺ) said “The Hajj is ‘Arafah.”\n",
  "hajjSub11Par5": "You will stay in ‘Arafah making duah until sunset (not congregational as some do). The best duah is that which you ask Allah with complete sincerity, from the bottom of your heart, acknowledging that none can answer you except Allah the AlMighty.\n\nOn this day Allah will boast to His angels, He will proudly speak about His slaves who came to Hajj. He will boast to the angels ‘just look at My slaves! They have come to Me with disheveled hair and covered in dust!’ Why? Because you endured all of that for His sake, Allah is so proud of you that He is boasting to His angels about you... your reward is with Him alone!",
  "hajjSub12Par1": "Then you will leave for Muzdalifah, you will offer the Maghrib and Isha prayer there shortened and combined. Make a lot of duah there, glorification of Allah, whatever you can and get some rest. But your main focus should be duah, to implore Allah of your wants and needs.",

We urge that if one is capable and fit enough to walk back then they should avoid the fighting, pushing, arguments etc. which takes place for transportation and walk back. Don’t risk invalidating your Hajj - the walk back is possible. After you have returned back to Mina you will start preparation to go and stone the Jamaraat (Jamaraat Al ‘Aqabah).",
  "hajjSub13Par1": "EID DAY!!\nYou will leave Muzdalifah in the early morning (EID day). After your arrival to Mina, the first thing you do is prepare to go and throw the pebbles, Jamaraat Al ‘Aqabah - you must be there before sunset and stone before Dhur (before the sun gets to the middle of the sky/before zawwal). On this day you will be stoning the big structure only. You go there and throw seven stones, each time you throw one you should throw with your right hand and say ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ - Allah is the greatest. Duah is not required here after stoning, you sacrifice your sheep, you go back to Mina and you shorten/shave your hair. Now you are absolved from the restrictions placed upon you from ihram except for sexual intercourse with your spouse (minor absolvement).",

But this time you will stone all three structures, the small one, the medium one and the big one, seven stones for each structure, you throw with your right hand and each time you say ‘Allah Hu Akbar.’ However this one you do after Zawwal, after Dhur time has come in. After the prophet stoned the second (medium) structure, he faced Makkah, raised his hands and made duah, and he did the same after stoning the third (small) structure too. You make duah for whatever you want and whatever you need, nothing is too much or too great for Allah to give or grant.",
  "hajjSub13Par4": "You need to make sure you get the stones into the hole around the structure or it is not valid, also you must throw all seven stones individually for each structure, to throw all seven stones at once is not accepted.",
  "hajjSub13Par5": "You can stay in Mina for up to two days or three days, it is up to you. But if you stay three days then you repeat the process of stoning all three structures again on the following (third) day. So in Mina you can stay three consecutive days or leave one day earlier (having stayed in Mina for a total of two days).",
  "hajjSub13Par6": "Note: The Shaaytan is NOT really there, you are not really stoning the devil so please refrain from getting extremely emotional or angry.

Ibrahim stoned the shaaytan and the shaaytan ran away. That’s why we relive the ritual of Ibrahim. It is a reminder that we should be like Ibrahim and not listen to the whisperings of the shaaytan, to pay no attention to shaaytan and follow the commands of Allah no matter what.",
  "hajjSub13Par8": "Due to Ibrahim’s obedience to Allah and patience as well as Isma’eel’s acceptance of Allah’s command and patience, Allah replaced the order of sacrificing Isma’eel with a ram.

However if you cannot touch it then there’s no problem - you continue to go around the Ka’bah like normal.\n• Walking around the Ka’bah seven times = one tawaaf\n• Tawaaf is just like the prayer, the only difference is you are allowed to speak during your circumambulation - make duah for whatever you want and need when going around - duah is not restricted to what’s written in the books.\n• Do not make supplication out loud and disturb other worshippers, Allah can hear you.",
  "hajjSub14Par12": "After you have performed tawaaf you go and offer two units of prayer - if you can behind Makam E Ibrahim (although these two units can be prayed anywhere in the masjid, even outside). In the first unit you recite with Al-Faatiha and Surat Al-Kafiroon and in the second unit you recite with Al-Faatiha and Surat Al-Ikhlaas if you can, however to recite using these verses is a sunnah, if you don’t know them or you forget, whatever you know/have memorised is sufficient.",

It is the end for your ritual act. You start your tawaaf from the Hajr Al-Aswad also known as the black stone. If you can kiss the stone then okay, if you cannot then you raise the right hand and say ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ from where you are as the prophet did. If it is crowded, do not push and hurt people especially just to get to the black stone, it is sufficient to raise the hand and say ‘Allah Hu Akbar.’",

When the water gushed out Hajr wanted to contain the water and not let it leave, so she said ‘don’t spread, don’t spread’, and so came about the name ZamZam. Allah rewarded Hajr when Allah ordered Ibrahim to leave Hajr and her infant Isma’eel in a desert in which nothing existed except a black stone, no birds, no life, completely empty. Due to her patience and trust in Allah, Allah blessed her and her infant with the miraculous water of ZamZam. Which later attracted life such as birds and the tribe of Jurhoom to settle in the area. Since that time all the way still now, Allah honoured Hajr by having people from all over of every kind to gather together in Makkah and perform Sa’i.

  "lifestyleA1Par1": "Shaykh Sulaymān al-'Alwān(حفظه لله) narrates a Story that's spoken about of al-Hāfidh Ibn Hajr(رحمه الله) regarding this Hadīth:\n“...Ibn Hajr(رحمه الله) & his companions were walking on a road, when a man who sells olives from the people of the book approached him & said: You're the one who's called Shaykh al-Islām. Your Prophet says \"The Dunyâ is a prison for the believer, and a Jannâh for the Kāfir\", so what Jannâh are we in right now, and what prison are you in? So Ibn Hajr(رحمه الله) said to him: You are in a Jannâh for what Allāh has\nreckoned for you of punishment in the hereafter if you die upon Kufr, and I'm in a prison for what Allāh has reckoned for us of comfort/bliss when we die upon Islām. ",
  "lifestyleA1Par2": "So the Kuffār today are considered to be in Jannâh, for what Allāh has reckoned for them with punishment [in the hereafter]...”\n\n~ Taken from a Lecture where he speaks about the Hadīth of \"Do not wish for death because of a distress that you are afflicted by\"",
  "lifestyleA2Par1": "Shaykh Sulaymān al-'Alwān has said this has Tafseel - If someone put up the Qur'ān with the intention of honouring/blessing the words of Allāh, this is not a known act and it takes the ruling of Amulets and the Prophet(ﷺ) warned against Amulets completely.\nHowever if someone put up the Qur'ān with the intention of protecting himself from accidents or troubles, then this is even worse than the previous case. And this is clear, whoever holds onto something besides Allāh has committed Shirk, and Amulets are completely prohibited, even if it's the Qur'ān because the Qur'ān is used for Ruqya, not for being an amulet.",
  "lifestyleA3Par1": "The most correct opinion in this matter is the permissibility of urinating while standing without it being disliked.\nHuthayfa(رضي الله عنه) said \"The Prophet(ﷺ) went to the dumps of some people, so he urinated standing, then he asked for water, so I brought water to him & he made wudū\" narrated by al-Bukhārī(رحمه الله) hadīth #224, from the chain of Shu'bah from al-A'mash from Abī Wā'il from Huthayfa(رضي الله عنه) and Imām Muslim(رحمه الله) narrated it [Hadīth #273] from the chain of Abī Khaythama from al-A'mash, and al-Bukhārī(رحمه الله) wrote a sub-heading for it \"The chapter of urinating while standing & sitting\" ",
  "lifestyleA3Par2": "And this is the practise of the early arabs, they would urinate standing & al-Islām has accepted that, as the Prophet(ﷺ) urinated while standing to show that it's permissible, and this is what a group from his Sahābah adopted, and ibn Sīreen(رحمه الله) and 'Urwa ibn al-Zubayr(رحمه الله) from the Tābi'een.",
  "lifestyleA3Par3": "Some of the scholars have abstained from acting upon the hadīth of Huthayfa(رضي الله عنه) because it's abrogated, and this is wrong.\nAnd a group of scholars have said, rather he urinated standing because of an injury in the back of his thigh(enclosed space between the knee) & there's a hadīth regarding this, but it's not authentic.\nAnd another group of scholars have said, rather he urinated standing because he couldn't find a place to sit.",
  "lifestyleA3Par4": "And Ā'isha(رضي الله عنها) has said \"Whoever informs you that the Prophet(ﷺ) would urinate standing, do not believe him, he would not urinate except sitting\" This was narrated by al-Tirmidhī(رحمه الله)... [Hadith #12] from the chain of Sharīk from al-Miqdām ibn Shurayh from his father from Ā'isha(رضي الله عنها) and it contains Sharīk who is weak in memory, Sufyān has also narrated this hadīth(same meaning & wording) which has been narrated by Ahmad(رحمه الله) and others.[So this hadīth gets raised as Hassan because of this\nfollow up] \nAnd there's no proof in the report to say it's disliked to urinate standing, indeed Ā'isha(رضي الله عنها) is reporting from her knowledge(that the prophet would only urinate sitting), while others have memorised what is hidden from her.",
  "lifestyleA3Par5": "And 'Omar ibn al-Khattāb(رضي الله عنه) said \"The Prophet(ﷺ) saw me while I was urinating standing, so he said 'Ya Omar, do not urinate standing', so I did not urinate standing after this\" and this is agreed upon regarding its weakness, and there's no hadīth Marfū'(from the Prophet(ﷺ)) to be used as proof to prohibit urinating while standing.",
  "lifestyleA3Par6": "What's correct, is that it's permissible, as the Prophet(ﷺ) has done so, and a group from among the Sahābah have done so, however urinating while sitting is better because it's what is mostly done from the Prophet(ﷺ) in his urinating and Allâh(جل وعال ) knows best.",

  "marriageA1Par1": "Shaykh Sulaymān al-'Alwān responded by saying: It's not allowed for either parent to compel their son into marriage with someone they don't want or love because the result of this marriage might end in a divorce or a miserable life for both of them. And it's not compulsory upon the son to obey them in this and it wouldn't be considered disobedience in doing so. However, it's necessary upon the son to be gentle in his rejection and to not raise his voice upon his parents or let them hear any bad words.",
  "marriageA2Par1": "Shaykh Sulaymān al-'Alwān(حفظه الله) responded by saying: By principle, that is considered permissible, and the prohibition isn't present from the Qur'ān, Sunnâh, Ijmā', saying of a Sahābī or valid Qiyās(analogy). And I do not know anyone from the scholars who prohibited or disliked that. Besides that some of the Fuqahā' disliked a woman to arouse her husband during menses, so that he doesn't fall into sin from doing anything further. [Note: You can do everything together, except Jimā']\nAnd some of the layman can mix up the ruling of this issue with the ruling of divorce during menses, however there isn't any correlation between the two matters.",
  "marriageA2Par2": "So the marriage contract while she's menstruating is permissible by the agreement of the scholars, and divorcing her during her menses is harām by the agreement of the scholars.\nAnd there are 2 sayings whether the divorce takes place or not (during her menses):\n\n1. That it occurs with it being harām and this is the saying of the 4 Imāms and the majority of the scholars.\n2. That it doesn't occur, which is the madhab of the Dhāhiriyyâh which was supported by Shaykh al-Islām ibn Taymiyyâh(رحمه الله) and ibn al-Qayyîm(رحمه الله).",
  "marriageA2Par3": "And every side from the 2 groups have mentioned their evidences with textual proof and reasoning, and after researching the evidences of both sides, and searching for the core evidences, and pondering over the Madhāhib(opinions) of the contemporary & classical scholars, and reading lengthy & summarised books regarding that, I saw strength(stronger proofs) in the second Madhab(opinion), and that it has better proofs which correlates with the fundamentals of the sharee'ah.",
  "marriageA2Par4": "And I have concluded that the Hadīths which are narrated to the Prophet(ﷺ) don't have anything from it which is clear regarding the issue, even though what's apparent from it(the hadīths) in my view shows that it doesn't count as a divorce. And the Mawqūf reports to ibn 'Omar(رضي الله عنهما) are contradictory and most of it isn't authentic, with the chances that it's referring to the latter view [the hadīths show that divorce doesn't occur], and Allâh(جل وعال ) knows best.",
  "marriageA3Par1": "I_Asked_My_Father - Regarding looking at one's fiancée, and what's permissible to be looked at?? \nShaykh Sulaymān al-'Alwān(حفظه الله) responded by saying: \nThe scholars do not differ regarding the permissibility of looking at one's fiancée, so he can look at whatever meets the need for attraction without being alone with the woman, and there's no disagreement that he can look at the face, but what's beyond that is differed upon, and what's correct is that he can look at what encourages him to marry her, of the face, hands, body and what a woman normally wears in her home in the presence of Women & Mahrams. \n~ The Questioner is 'Abdûl Malik al-'Alwān, the son of the Shaykh.",
  "marriageA4Par1": "The Shaykh responded by saying: There's no difference of opinion between the scholars that the virgin girl who isn't married, if she produces milk and breastfeeds with it, then that would cause them to become Mahrams, so the breastfed[child] will become her son, and he doesn't have a father, and ibn al-Mundhir(رضي الله عنه) in \"al-Ijmā\", ibn Qudāmah(رضي الله عنه) in \"al-Mughnī\" & others have alluded to this issue.",
  "marriageA5Par1": "A man has no right to remain absent from his wife without a legitimate excuse, merely because he wants to earn a living. If the period is so long that it brings harm to the woman, then it is not permissible for him to do that. The most he can remain absent from her is between four to six months; because Allāh the Almighty has set the limit for those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives to four months. Allāh the Almighty said: \n{marriageAya}\n“Those who take an oath not to have sexual relation with their wives must wait four months, then if they return (change their idea in this period), verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Sūrah Al-Baqarah 226]",
  "marriageA5Par2": "Similarly, there is a report from ‘Umar -although the chain is disconnected- that he allowed the Muslim soldiers to remain absent for six months. So anything longer than that must be agreed by the spouses. The husband should come to an agreement with his wife on a period of time that he is able to maintain, and the wife should cooperate with her husband as much as she can just as the husband should be kind to his wife as much as he can. And Allāh is the One Whose help is sought. ",
  "marriageA6Par1": " He who is intimate with his wife whilst she is on her menstrual cycle without knowing about the presence of menstrual blood, there is no sin upon him. However, it is obligatory upon him to make an expiation; and this is by giving away in charity one Dīnār or a half of it in gold (or its equivalent in currency). This is due to the generality of the statement of the prophet: \n{marriageHadith}\nHe who is intimate with his wife whilst she is on her menstrual cycle let him give a Dīnār or a half of it in charity. (Reported by Ahmad and the four Sunan compilers with a Sahīh chain of narration)",
  "marriageA6Par2": "It is obligatory upon the menstruating woman to inform her husband that she is on her menstrual cycle. And Allāh is the Granter of Success. May prayers and peace from Allāh be upon our prophet and his family.",
  "marriageA7Par1": "That is not permissible, unless she is severely harmed due to becoming pregnant; harm that is beyond the norm amongst pregnant women. If so, it is not permissible for the husband to prevent her from protecting herself from this severe harm by way of that which is less harmful (i.e. consuming these pills) due to the statement of the Prophet ﷺ ((There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm))\nAnd the statement of Allāh the Majestic and Exalted: \n{marriageAya}\n“Allāh wants for you ease and doesn't want for you difficulty.” ",
  "marriageA7Par2": "So it is not permissible for the husband to prevent her, rather he must strive to treat her - and she is excused even if she consumes these pills without her husband's knowledge.",
  "marriageQ1": "Is it permissible for a Father to force his son into marriage with a girl he doesn't desire?",

This pillar cannot be fulfilled until the person asserts Allah(سبحانه وتعالى )'s oneness and worships Him by belief, tongue and action. So if any of these requirements are violated, then the individuals' belief in Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) is insufficient.",
  "monotheistPar11": "Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab also said (regarding this): “There is no disagreement within the Muslim Ummah that Tawheed is by heart- which is knowledge, by tongue- which is verbal declaration, and by action- which is implementing what Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) orders and forbids, so if any of these are violated, the person cannot be regarded as a Muslim. And if the individual acknowledges Tawheed and does not implement it, he is an obstinate Kafir (disbeliever) like iblis (Shaitan) and Fi’raun, or if he implements Tawheed without believing in it, he is a pure Munafiq (hypocrite) who is worse than a Kafir.”",
  "monotheistPar12": "Abdullah ibn AbdurRahman Aba Battin said:\n“When the Muslim knows the greatness of the Shahaadah and its requirements and this should be by belief with the heart, articulation with the tongue and action with the limbs. So if one of these requirements is not met, the person is not regarded as a Muslim- as Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) has mentioned and explained this in His Book(Quran). If a person was a Muslim implementing all the pillars of his Deen, then he said or did anything that contradicts the Shahaadah, all that he did would not benefit him as Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) said about those who talked about the Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) after the battle of Tabuk:",
  "monotheistPar13": "“Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were the Mujrimun (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners).” Surah At Taubah: Ayah 66.\nAnd in the same Surah but Ayah 74 Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) says:",
  "monotheistPar14": "“They swear by Allah that they said nothing (bad), but really they said a word of disbelief, and they disbelieved after accepting Islam, and they resolved with that which they were unable to carry out, and they could not find any cause to do so except that Allah and His Messenger had enriched them of His Bounty. If then they will repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful torment in this wordly life and in the Hereafter. And there is none for them on earth as a Wali (supporter, protector) or a helper.”",

  "monotheistPar3": "3. All the acts of worship that should be directed to Him Alone because it is He Who Created and provided us and gives us life and causes us to die. Allah(سبحانه وتعالى‬)  says in Surah 30, Ayah 40: \n“Allah is He Who Created you, then provided food for you, then will cause you to die then (again) He will give you life (on the day of Resurrection). Is there any of your partners that do anything of that? Glory is to Him! And Exalted is He above all that they associate.”",
  "monotheistPar4": "Allah(سبحانه وتعالى) also says in Surah 2, Ayah 21:\n“O mankind! Worship your Lord Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become Al-Muttaqun.”",
  "monotheistPar5": "And in a Hadith reported by both Bukhari and Muslim Muaad ibn Jabal (radhiAllahu anhu) said, “ I was riding a donkey behind the Prophet (ﷺ) then he said “ O Muaad- Do you know the right of Allah on his slaves and the right of the slaves on Allah. Muaad said “Allah and His Messenger know best. He (ﷺ) said the right of Allah on His slaves is that they should worship Him and not ascribe partners with Him, and the right of the slaves on Allah is not to punish anyone who does not commit shirk. He (Muaad) said, “shall I tell people the good news” He (ﷺ) said “ Don’t do so lest they settle on this.”",
  "monotheistPar6": "And among these acts of worship are invocation, bowing, prostration, love, exaltation, fear, hope, repentance, submissiveness, reliance, vowing, sacrifice, asking for help and going to for judgment. So if anyone directs any of these acts to other than Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ), he becomes a Mushrik, even if he prays, fasts, goes to Hajj and claims to be a Muslim.",
  "monotheistPar7": "Secondly, a person should assert Allah azawajal's Oneness and worships Him by belief, tongue, and action, because worshipping Allah is based on two main pillars; the disbelief in Taghut and belief in Allah (سبحانه وتعالى ).",
  "monotheistPar8": "The disbelief in Taghut is the first pillar of Tawheed and this pillar cannot be fulfilled until the person rejects the Taghut by belief, tongue, and action, so if one of these requirements is violated, then the person cannot be regarded as a disbeliever in Taghut. For instance, if a person believes that Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) Alone is Al-Hakim (the Legislator) and declares this with his tongue, but later commits Kufr by appointing someone in a legislative authority which reserves the absolute right to legislate, then this person has committed Shirk by ascribing an act which is specific to Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) Alone to other than Allah.",
  "monotheistPar9": "Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab said: “So know that the Deen of Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) is in the heart in terms of belief, love and hatred, and in the tongue in terms of verbally pronouncing the shahaadah, and in the limbs in terms of implementing the pillars of Islam and avoiding actions which drive out of Islam. Therefore if any of these requirements are violated, the person becomes Kafir or Murtad (apostate).”",

  "prayerA1Par2": "However, if he [the traveller] enters/catches the Salāh outside the Rak'ah, such as the one who enters in the final Tashahhَud, so what's the correct in this situation is that he prays the Salāh of a traveller, not the Salāh of a resider, because he did not follow any part of the Salāh, and the Salāh is known by catching a Rak'ah, because of the saying of the Prophet ﷺ “Whoever catches a Rak'ah of Salāh, then he has caught the Salāh” and the proof this is also, “an opposing evidence” [daleel 'aks] as it's known by the Usَuliyeen [Scholars of Usَul al—Fiqh], and it's the issue of Salāh al—Jum'ah.",
  "prayerA1Par3": "If he joins in where the Imām is in the final Tashahَud of the Salāh, how would he pray? He would pray 4[Rak'ahs for Jum'ah], and if he prays a Rak'ah [with Imām], he prays 2 Rak'ahs [for Jum'ah], so that has proved that [the Salāh] is known by Rukَu', and this is a proof against Abَu Abَu Hanīfah﴾رحمه الله﴿ when he said that if joins in the final Tashahhَud with the Imām, that he prays the same as him, and he will be in the of following the Salāh, and when he was given the evidences regarding Jum'ah, he contradicted himself and didn't say anything regarding Jum'ah, and he said it for other Salāh [other that Jum'ah], so this is a proof against him in this issue. So whats correct in this issue is that if the Traveller prays a Rak'ah with the Mutim [the one who completes Salāh], he prays the Salāh of a Mutim, and if he joins in besides the Rak'ah [like in the final tashahhَud], the he prays the Salāh of a traveller.",
  "prayerA1Par4": "Note: Daleel 'Aksi according to the scholars of Usَul al—Fiqh means that if the Prophet peace be upon him said the optional prayers in the night are by two's [i.e Two Rak'ahs], therefore we understand from this that the optional prayers of the day are by 4's, so you pray 4 Rak'ah before Dhuhr and 'Asr. Btw there's difference of opinion regarding praying 4 Rak'ahs with 1 Salām, but the correct opinion is that it's correct & perfectly fine.",
  "prayerA20Par1": "Yes, the jamā'ah should still be established for whoever attends. However, it isn't wājib to do so, as this concession applies to all; if everyone was to take the concession and not attend the congregation, there is nothing wrong with this and no one would be sinful. With that said, it is still better for the congregation to be established, to accommodate for whoever is able to attend.",
  "prayerA21Par1": "The time of ‘isha begins with the disappearance of the red afterglow, and it is the redness which is spread out in the sky after the setting of the sun. As for the time in which salat-ul-‘isha ends, then the people of knowledge have differed regarding it, there are two views:",
  "prayerA21Par2": "The first view: is that it extends up until salat-ul-fajr, due to the generality of the hadith of Abu Qatadah in Muslim that Rasulullah(ﷺ) said: “...indeed there is no neglect in sleep, indeed neglect is only upon the one who didn't perform the prayer until the time of the next prayer arrived.”",
  "prayerA21Par3": "The second view: is that it extends until half of the night has passed, due to the hadith of Jibril narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdillah, and he mentioned therein: “...then he came to him for ‘isha, when half of the night had passed...”, or he said “a third of the night”, “...so he prayed ‘isha...”",
  "prayerA21Par4": "And the most correct is the second view, that it ends when half of the night has passed, because of the hadith of Jibril which has preceded, as it is a specification of the generality of the hadith of Abu Qatadah.\nAnd Allah (سبحانه وتعالى ) knows best.",
  "prayerA22Par1": "Sujûd as-sahw is legislated in the voluntary prayer, just as it is legislated in the obligatory [prayer], because there is no specific [proof to restrict it to the obligatory prayers], but the people of knowledge differed, between it being recommended or obligatory, and Allâh knows best.",
  "prayerA23Par1": "It should be known that completing the rows in congregational prayer is an obligation. It has been narrated in the Musnad and the Sunnan that the Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw a man praying alone behind the row so he waited until the man completed, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Repeat your prayer; there is no prayer for the man who stands alone behind the row” [Musnad of Imâm Ahmad]",
  "prayerA23Par2": "And a number of People of Knowledge held this hadith on its apparent meaning, so they said that the prayer is invalid for the one who prays alone behind the rows, but the most evident in his saying: “no prayer” is the completeness not the correctness, meaning the prayer is not complete, and this is indicated by a hadith of Abu Bakrah when he bowed without the joining the row as in Sahih Al-Bukhari.",
  "prayerA23Par3": "And the command of the Prophet (ﷺ) to repeat the prayer was to show the importance of the matter and this applies when there is a gap in the row but if the row is complete and he did not find a place in it, then there is nothing wrong with praying alone behind the rows.",
  "prayerA23Par4": "And it is not said that he pulls a man from the front rows to pray with him, as for this saying, although some scholars hold this view but it is not good. Because doing so  creates a gap in the front row and further it is injustice for the one who came earlier caused by the one who came late. \nAnd Allah, the Most High, Knows Best.",
  "prayerA24Par1": "No it is not allowed because he will explain and make exegesis (Tafsīr) of the Qur'an with his deviance. The Qur’an is the word of Allah, the entire religion is from the Qur’an, if you are not firmly established on it, you will fall into his deviance.  The righteous predecessors of this Ummah said: This knowledge is the religion, so look at and be careful who you take your knowledge and religion from!",
  "prayerA24Par2": "Imaam Maalik رحمه الله said, there are four categories of people you cannot take your knowledge from them:\n1) A foolish man who doesn't care about his foolishness - even if he is the most knowledgeable - do not learn from him.\n2) An innovator who guides people to his innovation.\n3) Whosoever continuously lies/the habitual liar, he is a well known liar to the people, even if he's not lying with the Prophet's ahadith he cannot be trusted or learnt from.\n4) A righteous worshipper who is not memorising what he's saying i.e., does not know what he's talking about regarding Quran and Sunnah, he is ignorant, being righteous is not a sign of possessing knowledge of the religion and its rules. He considers himself knowledgeable but he could not be further away from the truth. We see this category prominently today especially online.",
  "prayerA24Par3": "I want to take Imaam Maalik’s statement and add one more category to it:\n5) The one who teaches people but he doesn't know what he's talking about. The people who are doubtfully guessing at the unknown. Allah said (Interpretation of the meaning), do not say that which you have no proof of from Quran and Sunnah, without knowledge.\n\nFirst learn. Teaching without knowledge harms the people more than it benefits them.",
  "prayerA25Par1": "Masbahah or Subhah (prayer beads) were (prevalent) with the Buddhists and the Hindus, then it became (prevalent) with Christians, then it entered among the Muslims, so a number of the people of knowledge viewed its permissibility, and even authored (books) regarding that, just as As-Suyuti did where he composed «Al-Minhah fi as-Subhah».",
  "prayerA25Par2": "And likewise did his student Ibn Tulun, who composed «Al-Mulhah fi ma warada fi asl as-Subhah», and the most extensive from those who authored upon their approach was Abd al-Hayy al-Laknawi, where he authored «Nuzha al-Fikr fi Subhah ad-dhikr» and the truth, is that the truth is far removed from those who have inclined to it (beads being permitted).",
  "prayerA25Par3": "As for what was mentioned of the ahadith regarding their validity, then nothing from them is authentic, rather it was reported from the companions, (may Allah the Blessed and Exalted be pleased with them), that they forbade doing tasbih with them.",
  "prayerA25Par4": "On the authority of al-Salt ibn Bahraam, who said: “′Ibn Mas′ud passed by a woman who had a [masbahah] with which she was making tasbeeh, so he broke it and threw it aside, then he passed by a man who was making tasbeeh with pebbles, and he kicked him then said, ‘you have committed an unjust bid′ah, or (else) you have outdone the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ) in knowledge!’” Narrated by Ibn Waddah in Al-Bid′i wa an-Nahyi ′anha.",
  "prayerA25Par5": "And there are more narrations from Ibn Mas`ud and others (may Allah be pleased with them). So the basic principle is that it is sufficient for a person to do tasbih and dhikr with his fingertips, because they will be made to speak (testifying on the day of judgement), and whoever has difficulty in counting (on fingertips) then some of the people of knowledge, such as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may the mercy of Allah be on him) and others, have allowed him to do so (i.e count on prayer beads). \nAnd Allah knows best.",
  "prayerA26Par1": "This situation should be avoided all together, especially with the large quantity of segregation facilities available (and it being better for women to pray at home). However, in a situation where this can't be avoided, it is still not permissible for a woman to pray sitting down using this as an excuse, standing for the prayer is a rukn and a rukn cannot be dropped by something like that. Even though men can see the women she should to her part such as fulfilling the conditions of the hijab (for example, her clothing should be loose).",
  "prayerA26Par2": "During the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) the women used to offer prayer behind the men. In the Masjid it was the Imaam, next rows would be the men, the row after that would be the children and the back rows would be the women, of course you would get on occasions some Sahabah would end up coming to the prayer late, that doesn't mean that the female companion's of the Prophet would offer prayer sitting down due to it, they would continue their prayer as normal.",
  "prayerA26Par3": "Rukn can only be dropped with certain legitimate reasons such as sickness, illness, but an excuse like this is not legitimate to have the rukn drop as the women should be offering prayer in loose clothing and clothing which makes them unknown, it should be like an armour concealing her, it should not be exposing anything of hers - even her length or width! It is for this reason therefore that she must stand and prostrate even if she is offering in such a situation.",
  "prayerA2Par1": "Imām ibn al-Mundhir(رحمه الله) mentioned in his book \"Al-Ijmā'\" that the Scholars have agreed that if the women followed the Imām & prayed with him, that is sufficient for them. And if she catch a Rak'ah from Salāt al-Jum'ah, then she will pray on top of that And if she catch a Rak'ah from Salāt al-Jum'ah, then she will pray on top of that  her home, then she should pray 4[Rak'ahs]. And it's narrated from the authority of 'Abdullâh ibn Mas'ūd( عنه هللا ضي ر ) and ibn 'Omar( رضي عنهما )هللا that they said: \"If she caught a Rak'ah from Jum'ah, then she should complete the other[Rak'ah], and if she caught them sitting[i.e. Entered in Tashahhûd], she should pray 4[Rak'ahs].\"",
  "prayerA2Par2": "And Imām ibn al-Mundhir( هللا رحمه ) mentioned a Consensus that whoever misses Jum'ah from the Residers, that they should pray 4 Rak'ahs. And it's narrated from Abī Hanīfah(رحمه الله) and a group of scholars that if he entered into the Jum'ah prayer before the Imām gives Salāms, then he should pray 2 Rak'ahs, and if he did not follow the Imām in his Salāh, then he should pray 4 Rak'ahs by the agreement of the scholars.",
  "prayerA2Par3": "Note: The view of Imām Abū Hanīfah(رحمه الله) is weak, as Shaykh Sulaymān al-'Alwān( حفظه )هللا mentioned elsewhere. Because the Prophet(ﷺ) said \"Whoever catches a rak'ah of Salâh, then he has caught the Salâh\" so if you entered in the Tashahhûd, you should pray 4 Rak'ahs, not 2, because you haven't caught the Salâh علم وهللا ",

What's correct: That he doesn't renew his marriage contract, because there is no proof of this.",
  "prayerA4Par1": "We would say, did he pray at Hajj or not? If he prayed at Hajj, then he has entered to Islām and became a Muslim and his Hajj is Valid. And if he abandoned Salāh afterwards, we would call him a disbeliever, however if the returns back to Islām, his deed would return back to him. This is according to the most correct opinion amongst the scholars. because Allāh(جل وعﻻ) said: “And whoever of you turns away from his religion (to disbelief) and dies while being a disbeliever”  The meaning of this 'Ayah if he returns back to Islām, his deeds will be returned back to him, and the deeds aren't nullified except if he died upon disbelief, and this is one of the two sayings from Imām Ahmad ﴾رحمه الله﴿ and that was chosen by Shaykh al—Islām ibn Taymiyyāh﴾رحمه الله﴿.

  "prayerA5Par1": "If it's proven that he's not ignorant, and I believe that the abandoner of Salāh is a Kāfir, and you showed him the ruling and he refused to abandon it, then there's no prevention from calling him a Kāfir if it's proven to the person with absolute proof, and the people of knowledge differentiate between ruling upon the individual and between ruling upon in general, so Ahlal Sunnāh rule upon generally and do not rule upon the individual, until the conditions have been met and the preventions(of takfeer) have been removed, so if the conditions have been met in this issue and the preventions(of takfeer) have been removed, and the person views that the abandoner of Salāh is a Kāfir, then there's no prevention from ruling upon this man that he's a Kāfir, knowing that he doesn't pray and views the abandoner of Salāh as a Kāfir.

That it's obligatory & this is what's popular in the Madhab of Imām Ahmad, a narration from the Madhab of Imām Mālik(رحمه الله).\n2. That it's recommended & this is what's popular in the Madhab of Imām Abū Hanīfah, al-Shāfi'ī & Mālik, also a narration in the Hanbalī madhab as it was held by ibn Qudāmah(رحمه الله) & this is the view of the Majority of the Scholars.\n3.

  "prayerA6Par5": "However Shaykh Sulaymān al-'Alwān(حفظه الله) said the Qiyās of Imām al-Bukhārī(رحمه الله) is questionable because if this was the case, then we would have to say Bismillâh before the Takbīrāt at Hajj, and before we say the Adhān, and before we say Allâhu Akbar for Salâh, however no one has said this. Also, to support the view that it's not prescribed to say Bismillâh before Wudū' is that it's not Authentic from the Prophet(ﷺ) nor the Sahābah(عنهم هللا )رضي, and not a single Sahābī who described the Wudū' of the Prophet(ﷺ) mentioned that he said \"Bismillâh\", but rather they mentioned things which are of less importance.

But the first definition is more correct. As for the Salaat when it comes from the angels, then it means: Asking for forgiveness. And from the humans, it means supplication.

After that, the longer works from the books of ibn Taymiyyah and the leadings scholars of the  da’wah  , such as:  Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah and others.",
  "succinctSub11aPar2": "2. Tawhid  al-Asma was-Sifat :   You should start with the shorter works of Shaykhul-Islam ibn Taymiyyah, such as:  Al-Wasitiyyah and  Al-Hamawiyyah ,  then  At- Tadmuriyyah and the explanations of  Al-Wasitiyyah  . Then one proceeds with the longer works herein, e.g., the categories of creed from  Majmu’ al-Fatawa  ,  Dar [ at-Ta’arub al-‘Aql wan-Naql  ],  As-Sawa‘iq al-Mursalah  , and others.",
  "succinctSub11bPar1": "1. Tafsir :  it is an advanced knowledge, and the books are exhaustive, even the short summary versions of them. Here there is no  mutun .  Therefore, it is best for the student [of knowledge] to acquire portions of the other knowledges before he embarks on this journey. There are many books of  tafsir ,  and the majority of them are not free from  bida’ . The foremost books of  tafsir are the ones by: at-Tabari, al-Baghawi, ibn Kathir, ibn as-Sa’di, and  Ad-Durr al-Manthur  by as-Suyuti.",
  "succinctSub11bPar2": "2. Usul a  t-Tafsir  : among the superlative  mutun here is Muqaddimah at-Tafsir by Shaykhul-Islam ibn Taymiyyah. There are multiple elaborations and notes upon it which have been printed. I abridged it, along with adding other matters from the words of ibn Taymiyyah, and this can be found on the net.\n3. ‘Ulum  al-Quran :  among the most adequate of what has been written here is  Al-Itqan by as-Suyuti, although there is some bida’  in it.",
  "succinctSub11cPar1": "Its mutun are numerous; the most well-known being:  ‘Umdah al-Ahkam by al-Maqdisi,  Bulugh al-Maram by ibn Hajr,  Al-Muharrar by ibn ‘Abdil-Hadi, and  Al-Muntaqa by al-Majd ibn Taymiyyah. For the student, it behooves him to begin with  ‘Umdah [ al-Ahkam ]  due to its brevity, then to continue to  Bulugh [ al-Maram ]  or  Al-Muharrar ,  since they are about equal. Afterwards, one should move on to the explanations of these books, then come to the longer works, such as: Fath al-Bari ,   Sharh Muslim ,   Nayl al-Awtar  , and others.",
  "succinctSub11dPar1": "Among the famous  mutun herein are  Al-Bayquniyyah ,   Nukhbah al-Fikr by ibn Hajr,  Al-Muqidhah by adh-Dhahabi, then their explanations, along with the elaborations of  Muqaddimah ibn as-Salah  . After this comes the study of the books of the origins of  ahadith ,  the hidden defects, and the books of the histories of the narrators, etc. There are two matters I would like to point out:",
  "succinctSub11dPar2": "Firstly , most of the science of  hadith books in existence today are upon the methodology of the later  hadith scholars, in contradiction to the  manhaj  of the early scholars. ",
  "succinctSub11dPar3": "Secondly , the mere abstract theoretical study of this science carries  very little benefit. Thus it is incumbent upon the student [of knowledge], if he wants the benefits, to carry out case studies and to look at the origins of the  hadith himself, and to go directly to the books of the origins, the men of the chain, and the hidden defects.",
  "succinctSub11ePar1": "Here, the well known mutun are  Al-Waraqat by al-Juwayni,  Mukhtasar ibn al-Hajib  , and  Al-Minhaj b y al-Baydawi, then their explanations, then the longer works such as  Al-Mustasfa  ,  Al-Ihkam  ,  Al-Bahr al-Muhit ,  etc. There are two matters that I would like to make mention here:",
  "succinctSub11ePar2": "Firstly , most of the books of  usul are not free from the  bida’ of the mutakallimun (people of rhetoric). The exceptions, however, include Rawdah an-Nadir by ibn Qudamah, and the notes on it from ash-Shanqiti were published under the title  Mudhkirah fi Usul al-Fiqh . [Also you have]  Sharh al-Kawkab  al-Munir by ibn an-Najjar al-Futuhi. And I compiled  Usul Fiqh Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah , which can be found online.",
  "succinctSub11ePar3": "Secondly , books on  usul are difficult to understand due to the multiples of technical terms and jargon. Therefore, it is best for the beginner to start by reading the works of contemporary scholars in this science, because they are easier to comprehend and use easier language. These include:  Usul al-Fiqh by Khallaf, al-Khudari, Zaydan, and others. When one has finished with them, then he moves on to the works of the early scholars.",
  "succinctSub11fPar1": "The  mutun vary according to the different schools of thought,  Al-Kanz for the Hanafiyyah,  Mukhtasar al-Khalil f  or the Malikiyyah,  Al-Minhaj for the Shafi‘iyyah, and  Zad al-Mustaqni’ for the Hanabilah. Then one moves on to their explanations, then to the longer works like Al-Mughni  ,  al-Majmu’ ,  etc. And for the one who does not adhere to any specific school of thought, then for him is  Ad-Durar  al-Bahiyyah by ash-Shawkani and its explanation  Ar-Rawdah  an-Nadiyyah by Siddiq al-Qanuji.",
  "succinctSub11fPar2": "There are two matters that I would like to make mention here:\nFirstly , many who ascribe to following  hadith in our times criticize following a school of thought and those books, but this needs to be reviewed; what is blameworthy is blind fanaticism. There is no problem learning and knowing the schools of thought by these books. And here there is a detailed elaboration which is not suitable to go through now.",
  "succinctSub11fPar3": "Secondly , I recommend the student [of knowledge], after coming to know  fiqh and its  usul ,  to read the books of  al-Fuqaha al-Ahrar (  lit. the free scholars of fiqh), those who do not strictly adhere to a particular school of thought: ibn Hazm, ibn Taymiyyah, ibnul-Qayyim, and ash-Shawkani. 3 They help the student tremendously and allow them to develop the capacity for  ijtihad  , hold the revealed texts in high esteem, and consider the statements of men based upon them.",
  "succinctSub11gPar1": "The student [of knowledge] begins with  Al-Ajrumiyyah ,  continuing on to its explanation  At-Tuhfah as-Saniyyah ,  alongside the summarized books of ibn Hisham, such as  Sharh Shudhur adh-Dhahab and  Sharh Qatr an-Nada  , and then onto the more detailed works, such as  Mughni al-Labib  and the explanations upon  Al-Alfiyyah  , etc. There are two matters that I would like to make mention here:",
  "succinctSub11gPar2": "Firstly , mastering grammar in theory does mean being safe from grammatical mistakes due to one’s tainted upbringing, as it is known that even some of the leading scholars of grammar fell into grammatical errors. And one of the best ways to improve the tongue (i.e., your speech) is for the student [of knowledge] to read a number of books with the  tashkil (  with the  harakat  ), while reading the  harakat (the vowel markings) out loud. Each time he increases reading like this, his tongue will become more fluent, and with repetition of this, the student [of knowledge] develops a natural ability and knowledge of the Arabic language, if Allah ﷻ  wills it to be so.",
  "succinctSub11gPar3": "Secondly , the perfection of grammar theoretically and practically means being safe from grammatical errors and knowing the  i’rab (how words decline); it does not mean having eloquent speech, a beautiful portrayal, and impressive style. That is found in the books of  adab  , not grammar. So if the student [of knowledge] wants to improve his style, he should look into the books of Arabic poetry, the works on eloquence, and the leaders of beautiful speech. He should attempt to memorize as much as he can of poems and sayings of  adab  ; and he should refer to the books on  al-insha 4 like  Al-Mathal as-Sa’ir by ibnul-Athir, etc.",
  "succinctSub12Par1": "After the student [of knowledge] gains an understanding of the  shar’ ,  he should gain an understanding of the  waqi’ (on the ground realities), in order to tie it to the  shar’ and to know its ruling. So he observes the contemporary schools of thoughts with regards to beliefs and theories, and learns new  fiqh issues, and goes back to the books containing new encyclopedias and follows the events; but he needs to be balanced here, so that it does not become a burden upon him.",
  "succinctSub13Par1": "The student [of knowledge] should strive to be firm in knowledge before he sets himself up for teaching. And he should continue to learn, even after he begins to teach, as Imam Ahmad said, “[Seeking knowledge is] from the cradle to the grave.”",
  "succinctSub14Par1": "It is upon the student [of knowledge] to adorn himself with manners and etiquettes of seeking [knowledge] in himself and with his teachers, colleagues, students, and others. Many scholars of the past and present have written numerous works on this issue, so it is best to refer to them.",
  "succinctSub14aPar1": "These are some writings and essays that I advise the seeker of knowledge to read, to look into repeatedly, and to refer back to constantly:",
  "succinctSub14aPar2": "1. All of the writings of Shaykhul-Islam ibn Taymiyyah and his student ibnul-Qayyim رحمه الله, as their works are based upon the understanding of the Book and Sunnah, and they are the mainstay of the  salafi  methodology. 5\n2. All of the writings of al-Hafidh adh-Dhahabi(رحمه الله)  , as he is, indeed, a investigative researcher.\n3. All of the writings of al-Hafith ibn Rajab(رحمه الله)  , in particular:  Fath al-Bari ,   Sharh al-‘Ilal  ,  Jami’ al- ‘Ulum  , and\nAl-Qawa‘id ,  due to the benefits found in them that can not be found elsewhere.\n4. Fath al-Bari by al-Hafidh ibn Hajr, as it is not just an elaboration of [ Sahih ]   al-Bukhari  , rather, it is an explanation of all the books of  sihah (  pl. of  sahih  ),  sunan  , and  masanid (pl. of musnad  ); and it is the mainstay for the commentators of  hadith after him",
  "succinctSub14aPar3": "5. All of the writings of the leadings scholars of the  Da’wah an-Najdiyyah رحمه الله, and in particular:  Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah  , for it is as its name suggests. 6\n6. All of the writings of Shaykh ‘Abdur-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi(رحمه الله)  , the Dhahabi of our times, in particular: At-Tankil  and  Al-Anwar al-Kashifah  .\n7. The notes written by Shaykh ‘Abdur-Rahman ibn Qasim upon Ar-Rawd al-Murbi’ ,  as it is from the most excellent of what has been written in  fiqh ,  and there are points, gems, and benefits in it that can not be found elsewhere.\n8. All of the writings of Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd(رحمه الله)  , for he is amongst the excellent contemporaries in authorship, articulating various issues, and the best of them in benefits.\n9. In regard to what the contemporaries have written in the science of  hadith  , the works of Shaykh Tariq ibn ‘Awdillah are from the foremost of what has been written; his books are precious, and his elucidation of  Nukhbah al-Fikr is from the best of its explanations.",
  "succinctSub14aPar4": "This [is the methodology] for one to undertake to help facilitate his goal.\n\nMay the  salah  of Allah be upon our prophet Muhammad, his household, and his companions altogether.",
  "succinctSub1Par1": "It is necessary for the student of knowledge to purify his intentions; and this command is well-known. However, the path is long, the highway robbers are spread out, and the calamities that affect the intention are many and hidden. Thus it is necessary for the student of knowledge to renew his intention constantly, as it is a thing which changes many times.",
  "succinctSub2Par1": "This is achieved through acts of obedience, adhering to  istighfar (seeking forgiveness), renewal of  tawbah (repentance), and avoiding disobedience, for they are amongst the greatest obstacles in the pursuit of knowledge. The student of knowledge is denied [knowledge] and forgets what he memorizes and understanding becomes difficult, all due to disobedience.",
  "succinctSub3Par1": "Requesting Him, calling upon Him, being humble before Him, breaking down between His hands, seeking guidance and correctness from Him, attaching [oneself] to “ la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah ”  (there is no strength nor power except with Allah) and the multitude of supplications narrated on this subject, like: \n{succinctDua1}\n “ Rabbi zidni ‘ilma  ” (My Lord, increase me in knowledge)\n{succinctDua2} \n“Subhanaka la ‘ilma lana illa ma ‘allamtana, innaka anta al- ‘Alim al-Hakim ” (Glorified are You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise)\n {succinctDua3}\n“ Allahumma ‘allimni ma yanfa‘uni wanfa’ni bima ‘allamtani  ” (O Allah, teach me what benefits, and benefit me with what you teach me) \n{succinctDua4}\n“ Allahumma faqqihni fid-Din wa ʿ allimnit-tawil ”  (Oh Allah, grant me understanding of the Din, and teach me its interpretation) \n{succinctDua5}“ Allahumma ya Mu ʿ allima Adama wa Ibrahima ʿ allimni, wa ya Mufahhima Sulaymana fahhimni  ” (Oh Allah, the One who taught Adam and Ibrahim, teach me, and oh One who gave understanding to Sulayman, grant me understanding)",
  "succinctSub4Par1": "It is upon the student to act upon his knowledge, as this is the objective of knowledge; it is not for adorning oneself with it in front of the people. Therefore, it is incumbent upon him to strive in acts of obedience and to increase in the  nawafil (voluntary acts) from  qiyam (night  salah  ),  siyam (fasting),  sadaqah (charity), recitation,  dhikr (remembrance of Allah), and others. And I would like to point out two issues here:",
  "succinctSub4Par2": "1. Occupying oneself to only reading books, memorizing  mutun (short texts), gathering and teaching knowledge, instills hardness in the heart; thus making worship heavy on the student. Due to that, he should take off during his study periods for voluntary worship. He should study the lives of the righteous, because this softens the heart and encourages one to action, with the permission of Allah.",
  "succinctSub4Par3": "2. Here there is a misconception, which some lazy students of knowledge bring, those whom knowledge is easy but worship is heavy. It is: “seeking knowledge is better than voluntary acts of worship.” This misconception should not deceive anyone, as the two matters do not clash with each other in principle that one has to put one over the other. You should take a look at the great scholars of the  ummah from the  Sahabah  , the  Tabi‘in ,  and those after them, and see they were famous for their worship. Knowledge is only given precedence over worship if there is a clash between the two and no way to reconcile and join both matters together; and this does not appear except in rare specific cases.",
  "succinctSub5Par1": "The student must work hard, be diligent, and strive, particularly at the start of seeking [knowledge]. It is said:  excellence consists of one tenth intelligence and nine tenths of strenuous effort . And whoever complains about a weakness in being able to memorize or understand, can make amends by having a strong will, abandoning laziness, and doubling the efforts. So for whoever’s aspirations are strong, intentions are corrected, and strives rightfully in his affairs will reach the goal, if Allah wills.",
  "succinctSub6Par1": "The student [of knowledge] should not busy himself - especially in the beginning - with the structures of the path, from the strangest of issues and oddities of knowledge for which there is no value except for the passing of time and overcoming peers. Rather, he should be active in mastering the principles of the sciences and comprehending the most important matters.",
  "succinctSub7Par1": "Thus the student [of knowledge] should seek the truth with its proof from the Book and the Sunnah without being fanatical towards a madhhab ,  scholar, or  shaykh  , for everyone’s statement can be accepted or left except for the Prophet’s ( sallallahu ‘alayhi wasallam )  .",
  "succinctSub8Par1": "The principles are of two types:\n1. The foundation of all the sciences, and it is:  at-tawhid  ; the student [of knowledge] would never be excused for being ignorant of it.\n2. The  usul of the sciences which the student [of knowledge] studies - here the general meaning of  asl is meant, not the specific one. So the  usul of every field is its most important chapters, categories, terminologies, and its issues.",
  "succinctSub9Par1": "Therefore, it is a must for the student to memorize the  mutun ,  the evidences, the sayings [of the scholars], and the core matters. The levels of memorization are four: \n1. Memorizing the words of the  mutun  ; and this is the foundation. The student should not leave this unless it becomes difficult for him.\n2. Memorizing the  mutun by their meanings; so the student memorizes the  matn in full, either by its wording or by its meaning and doesn’t stick to the author’s words because it is not an issue of worship.",
  "succinctSub9Par2": "3. Choosing what to memorize; thus if the  matn is very long and the student finds it difficult to memorize, then he should abridge it to the point that it is no longer difficult for him. He does so by choosing the most important sections and matters, if it is a written text, or the important lines, if it is a poem, and he should seek assistance from those who are experienced from the people of knowledge, and then after that he should memorize what he has chosen.\n4. Choosing what to preserve either by its wordings or by its meaning.",

He held a unique and unparalleled position as an exponent of Qur'an, Hadith and different branches of knowledge. With his intellect and a deep grasp over the religious learning, he impressed the high ranking contemporary scholars and brought them around his own viewpoints. In his works, Sheikh-ul-Islam has not only elaborated the Qur'an and Sunnah, but has also uprooted the polytheistic views and has made a hard struggle to eradicate the heresies and accretions.\n\n~ نواقض التوحيد \n~ شروط الصلاة وأركانها ومتطلباتها",

  "tawheedBookAuthor": "محمد بن عبد الوهاب (رحمه الله)",
  "tawheedQ1": "What is the correct view with regards to the ruling on the Sāhir? ",
  "tawheedQ1Par1": "The Shaykh(حفظه الله) responded by saying: Al-Sihr in all of its forms is Harām in every Sharī'ah, and is agreed upon regarding its prohibition and the prohibition of learning it. And it goes against what the Messengers() came with, and contradicts the purpose of what the books[revelations from Allâh] were sent for.",
  "tawheedQ1Par2": "And the majority of the scholars adopted the view that the Sāhir is a Kāfir, and it's compulsory upon the leader of the muslims to kill him. Allâh(سبحانه وتعالى) said \"It was not Sulaymān who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people Sihr(magic)\" and Allâh(سبحانه وتعالى) said \"But [the two angels] do not teach anyone unless they say, \"We are a trial, so do not disbelieve\", i.e. [do not disbelieve] by doing Sihr, so it's evident that this is Kufr.",
  "tawheedQ1Par3": "And most of the Fuqahā' from the Shāfi'iyyâh adopted the view that the Sāhir doesn't disbelieve, unless he believes the permissibility of Sihr or believes similar to what the people of Bābil believe, from getting closer to the 7 stars.\nAnd this is disputable, and there's no evidence to condition \"Belief\" [for Sihr to be Kufr].",
  "tawheedQ1Par4": "And what's correct is that the Sāhir is a Kāfir, whether he believes it's Harām or not, so simply performing Sihr is Kufr, and this is what's clear from the evidences, and there is nothing in the other texts which opposes this.\nAnd when the description/title of Sihr is established upon an individual, he is to be killed, as that has been proven from a group of the Sahābah, however it's not allowed for anyone among the people to apply the Punishments without the command of the Sultān[Chief/Leader] or whoever holds his place, because applying the Punishments without the command of those in authority will result in corruption, and destabilisation for the safety[of the country], and the consideration of the Sultān will disappear.[Basically becomes chaos, everyone taking it into his own hands]",
  "tawheedQ2": "What is the difference between ittibā' and Taqlīd?",
  "tawheedQ2Par1": "Ittibā' is to follow an imām based on evidence which he provides from the Sharī'ah; this is called ittibā' - not taqlīd. It is not blameworthy to refer to oneself as a follower of a particular Imām/scholar - if this is based on evidence. The evidence for that i.e. to say that I follow Imām so-and-so intending by that adherence to the Sharī‘ evidences, is the ḥadīth of Al-Irbādh ibn Ṣāriyah; that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said: \"Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Caliphs. Cling firmly to it with your molars.\"",
  "tawheedQ2Par2": "A more explicit evidence is the saying of Allāh - in reference to the Companions, may Allāh be pleased with them all:\n{tawheedAya}\n“As for the foremost—the first of the Emigrants and the Helpers—and those who follow them (ittaba‘ūhum) in goodness,”  [Sūrah At-Tawbah 100]",
  "tawheedQ2Par3": "So He (The Almighty) called that ittibā‘; although what's intended is adhering to the Sharī‘ evidences. Similarly, the saying of Allāh: \n{tawheedAya2}\n“And whoever defies the Messenger after guidance has become clear to them and follows a path (yattabi‘) other than that of the believers,” \n[Sūrah An-Nisā' 115]",
  "tawheedQ2Par4": "Indicating that following the path of the believers may be referred to as ittibā'. Likewise, it comes in the ḥadīth (that the Prophet ﷺ said): “If they obey Abū Bakr and ‘Umar, they will be rightly guided,” and in another ḥadīth: “Follow the two after me; i.e. Abū Bakr and ‘Umar;” the first ḥadīth is reported by Muslim on the authority of Abū Qatādah, and the second is reported by Aḥmad on the authority of Ḥudhayfah(رضي الله عنه).\nAlso, (another evidence is) the general meaning found within the saying of Allāh:\n{tawheedAya3}\n“Follow those who ask no reward of you, and are ˹rightly˺ guided.” [Sūrah Yā-Sīn 21]",
  "tawheedQ2Par5": "And this Āyah extends beyond the Prophets. As for Taqlīd (blindfollowing); it is to follow someone who is not himself a ḥujjah (evidence) without ḥujjah (evidence) And concerning this Allāh the Almighty said:\n{tawheedAya4}\n“Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not take others as guardians besides Him.” [Sūrah Al-A'rāf 3] And all Praises and thanks belong to Allāh, Lord of everything.",
  "tawheedQ3": "Why is it important to know where Allāh is according to Ahlul-Sunnah?",
  "tawheedQ3Par1": "This is because many deviated on this topic of ‘Uluw (Allāh being above the ‘Arsh). Denying this Attribute of Allāh leads to the denial of the attribute of Istiwā’ (rising) of Allāh above His ‘Arsh in a manner befitting His Majesty and this leads to denial of Āyāt in the Qur’ān as Allāh has clearly stated this, so you can see why it’s so dangerous.",
  "tawheedQ3Par2": "If many people are asked where is Allāh, they would say Allāh is in the Heavens, or Allāh is everywhere (even in filthy places wal-‘Iyathubillāh) or Allāh sits on the Throne. However this isn’t the case and doesn’t align with the correct belief. We believe Allāh’s knowledge encompasses everything but Allāh isn’t physically present everywhere. Allāh is above His ‘Arsh and He rose over it in a manner that is befitting to His Majesty.",
  "tawheedQ3Par3": "Allāh is aware what happens to His creation in this world and what will happen to them in the Hereafter but we will never encompass anything of His knowledge. If we speak aloud, then undoubtedly Allāh knows and He knows the secrets and that which is more hidden to us. Allāh descends to the lowest heaven every night in a manner which befits Him. We don’t ask how or change the meaning as this is how people deviated.",
  "tawheedQ3Par4": " At-Tirmidhī (رحمه الله) has a lengthy statement concerning this issue. To mention briefly, he stated:\n“It has been said by more than one scholar from the People of Knowledge about this narration and similar reports regarding the Attributes of Allāh — and that our Lord descends to the nearest heaven every night. So the scholars said: ‘Affirm these narrations, have faith in them, do not imagine them, nor ask how.’” [As-Sunan of At-Tirmidhī (No. 662)]",
  "tawheedQ3Par5": "Therefore, Allāh is above His creation, above the world, above the Heavens, above his ‘Arsh. He also has full control over all the beings and His creation and is above everyone and everything in this control. This is the ‘Aqīdah of the people of Truth, the Sunnah and Jamā’ah. And Allāh knows best.",
  "tawheedQ4": "WHAT IS THE RULING ON THE ONE WHO JUDGES BY OTHER THAN WHAT ALLAAH HAS REVEALED AND WHAT IS WAAJIB (OBLIGATORY) ON US TOWARDS HIM ?",
  "tawheedQ4Par1": "Shaykh Ali al Khudayr: The ruler who rules by other than what Allah  sent down, whether that is by the man made laws or whether it is by customs  and traditions, theses are kuffaar mushrikeen. Allaah said: He makes none to share in His Decision and His Rule [Al-Kahf 18:26] And Allaah Said: The decision is only for Allah [Al-An'aam 6:57]",
  "tawheedQ4Par2": "*AND THEIR KUFR IS KUFR AKBAR* (major kufr) by Ijmaa (concensus) and this consensus was reported by Ibn Kathir and others from his contemporaries from Ahlus Sunnah. Allaah Said: And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the Kafirun. [Al-Maaidah 5:44] And Allah Says: “Have you seen those (hyprocrites) who claim that they believe  in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before  you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the Taghut (false judges, etc.) while they have been ordered to reject them.” [An Nisaa' 4:60]",
  "tawheedQ4Par3": "And Allah Says: Or have they partners with Allah (false gods), who have instituted  for them a religion which Allah has not allowed. [Ash-Shoora 42:21] And this is the case today, we see them judge between the people by the man  made laws and in some places that is called by other than its name, however we look at the reality and the meaning (of these laws) and not the name  and deceits (given to them). As for the Judge, if he judges in a single case by his whims or desires, and not  according to the man made laws, regulations, the system or by customs or traditions, then this here is Kufr Duna Kufr, as in the hadeeth:",

(reported in the Sunan) And Ibn Abdil Barr said in “Al Tamheed” that this example is from the major sins by ijma – and this was what happened in that Umawiyyah and Abbasiyyah states. ",
  "tawheedQ4U": "Understanding the Question: What is the Shariah ruling (or judging) by other than what Allah sent down (i.e. The Shariah) and is it like the rulers of the Ummawiyaah and Abassiyah states - KUFR DUNA KUFR – or is their kufr the kufr which exits one from the Millah (Islam, i.e Major kufr). And what is Waajib on us towards these rulers so as that we will be excused in front of Allah, in either situation ?",

  "tawheedQ6Par1": " Know that the narration of ibn abbaas (رضي الله عنه) saying Kufr Duna Kufr (Kufr of a lesser degree) is a weak and it’s Muttarib narration means Unstable and not authentic as researched by great Scholar of Hadiths Shaikh Sulaymaan ibn Naasir Al-Ulwaan(حفظه الله) he said: \"As for the statement of those who said it is [Surah Ma'idah 44] KUFR DUNA KUFR (Lesser Disbelieve) in reference to the Hadith  of Abbas, Imām Hākim said; it related by Hishām  bn Hujayr from Tawus from Ibn Abbas who said it is KUFR DUNA KUFR (KUFR of a lesser Disbelieve) and this Hadith is weak of two defect:",
  "tawheedQ6Par2": "The first defect: is the weakness of Hishām bn Hujayr (as a narrator).\nThe second deffect: the Hadith is in contrary to a Hadith that is agreed upon by the consensus, it has been related by Abdullah bn Fawas, from his father, from Ibn Abbas who said: it is (Ruling by other than what Allah has revealed) is KUFR [Major Disbelieve]. And this is a Major Kufr which goes in conjunction with the statement of Allah;",
  "tawheedQ6Par3": "He makes none to share in His Decision and His Rule [Al-Kahf 18:26] And Allah Says: “Have you seen those (hyprocrites) who claim that they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the Taghut (false judges, etc.) while they have been ordered to reject them.” [An Nisaa' 4:60] Scholars cannot make up their mind about who said this statement “Kufr Duna Kufr”. Some of them said, ibn abbaas said it and some said Taawus said it (a Taaba’ee who never met prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم .(Firstly, this difference should be cleared because this is not clear who made this statement.",
  "tawheedQ6Par4": "Let’s say for argument sake that Ibn Abbaas said Kufr Duna Kufr. What was he talking about ? Who was he talking to ? Ibn Abbaas was talking to Khawarij who lived in the time of Ali (رضي الله عنه). Ibn abbaas wasn’t talking about the Sharee’ah. Do you know why ? Because he did not dismantle the Sharee’ah during his caliphate and he was one of the four rightly guided Caliphs. So the Sharee’ah was not called into question. Therefore, the Sharee’ah was not the subject which was being discussed. Ibn Abbaas was talking about the Fitnah of Ali and Muaaviyah (RadiyAllaahu Anhuma). Sahaabah killing Sahaabah.",
  "tawheedQ6Par5": "The Madkhali put a spin on the Hadith and said: “What Ibn Abbaas meant is the Sharee’ah of Allaah. When you dismantle the Sharee’ah of Allaah it is Kufr Duna Kufr (minor kufr). So when you dismantle the Sharee’ah don’t worry about it, because it’s minor kufr”. From here the Madkhali accused Allah of extremism when Allah punished the people of Sabath for dismantling the  law of Allah at the time by turning them to apes and swine! Albeit it was just a (minor Kufr)",
  "tawheedQ6Par6": "This is the spin they (Madkhali) put on it. We say to them. Ibn Katheer and ibn Taymiyyah said: Ibn Katheer said: “So whosoever abandons the wise sharee’ah which was revealed to Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) the seal of prophets and goes to other abrogated sharee’ah for judgement, he becomes a kaafir. So how about the one who goes to al-yaasiq (man-made law) for judgment and gives it precedence over the sharee’ah of Muhammad. Whosoever does this has become a kaafir by the ijmaa (consensus) of the muslims. [Al-Bidaaya Wan-Nihaaya, Vol-13, Pg : 119] ",
  "tawheedQ6Par7": "Examine carefully the Fatwa of Ibn Katheer. He said: “The mere abandonment of the Sharee’ah makes him a Kaafir.”A Madkhali, Saudi salafi will say: “You have to abandon the Sharee’ah plus have to give legitimacy to the abandonment. You have to do istihlaal (to make what is Halaal and Haraam) So as long as you didn’t legitimise its abandonment and didn’t do istihlaal you’re fine and good to go and you’re a Muslim perfect in Eemaan.”This is how evil this people are. The hadith Kufr Duna Kufr is a weak hadith and you can’t base your Aqeedah on weak hadith.",
  "tawheedQ6Par8": "Ibn taymiyyah said: And it is known from the religion of islaam by necessity and by the consensus of all muslims that whoever legalizes to follow other than the Sharee’ah of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم),he is a Kaafir. And his Kufr is similar to that of the one who believes in some part of the book (qur-aan) and reject some of it.” [Majmu’ Al-Fataawa, Vol-28, Pg : 524]",
  "tawheedQ6Par9": "If to dismantle the sharee’ah of allaah was a minor issue, why did allaah change the jews to apes and swine in the time of David when they dislodged the sharee’ah ? [Al-Maaidah:60] May be Madkhalis are saying, Allaah was overreacting. May be that’s what they’re claiming that He (Allaah) was overreacting because he turned the jews into apes and swine for something which was minor (Na’oozubillaah).

  "usuryPar2": "1. That Zinā is greater in Harām than Ribā in both its types: Debt and Remnants.\n2. That committing adultery with Mahrams is from the biggest of Harām, and from the greatest of sins, and a group among the Scholars have gone to say that whoever commits adultery with a Mahram of his is to be struck with the sword, even if he was not Married, and that is because of the severe matter of Zinā, but the Majority of the Scholars went to say that he's lashed like others, and it's completely fine to whip him[Ta'zīr].\nAnd thereupon, how can you make the Ribā dealings, and the lowest level of Ribā greater in prohibition in the sight of Allâh(وتعالى )سبحانه than a man who commits adultery with a Mahram of his?!! Rather, he committed adultery with his Mother, wal-'Iyāthû Billâh?!!.",
  "usuryPar3": "3. That the Prophet(ﷺ) said in the Hadīth \"The most prevalent kind of Ribā is going to lengths in talking unjustly against a Muslim's honour.\" So the outward meaning of this Narration is that the most severe Ribā in the sight of Allâh(وتعالى )سبحانه is going into length in talking unjustly against a Muslim's honour, and what kind of elongation is more severe than having a slave[of Allâh] commit Zinā with his Mother, this is the greatest type of elongation[going to lengths in talking unjustly against a Muslim's honour]",
  "usuryPar4": "So it's understood that the last Hadīth contradicts the first [Hadīth], because if he said \"And the lowest is a man committing adultery with his Mother, & The most prevalent kind of Ribā is going to lengths in talking unjustly against a Muslim's honour.\", it is as if this report doesn't consider committing adultery from going into lengths in talking unjustly against a Muslim's honour, and sufficient is the gruesomeness and atrociousness of that.",
