  "hajjA1par10": "4. And a group of scholars have permitted a woman to travel in all cases if she was with a group of trustworthy women.\n5. And another group of scholars have completed forbidden a woman to travel in all cases, except in what the scholars have agreed upon in the 3 situations mentioned above[if she reverted n.k...], and this is the Madhab of Imām Ahmad(رحمه الله), and is more suitable/correlates with the apparent/clear text \"A woman cannot travel except with a Mahrâm\". HOWEVER, if it occurs that the woman travels without a Mahrâm, her Hajj is complete/accepted in Islām. ",
  "hajjA1par11": "Note: The definition of \"travelling\" goes back to the 'Urf(customs) of the time - It's not permissible to use the hadīths \"Travel for 3 days without Mahram\" in today's sense where a person can basically travel the whole world in that specified time period. Rather, whatever is considered \"Travelling in our times\" even if it was 1 hour on a plane n.k... is considered harām if it was without a Mahram اعلم وهللا ",
  "hajjA1par2": "And from this, the majority of the scholars have stated that it's not permissible for a woman to make Hajj except with a Mahram, regardless if her Hajj was compulsory or optional, and regardless if the woman was young or old, and regardless if the travelling distance was long or short. And some of the scholars are of the view that a woman can make Hajj with a group of trustworthy women, infact Imām Mālik(رحمه الله) & al-Shāfi'ee(رحمه الله) said she is compelled to go to Hajj with a group of women, Yaani in the compulsory Hajj, and from al-Shāfi'ee(رحمه الله) is a second saying in the issue \"that the woman goes out(for Hajj) even if she was with one woman that's trustworthy\", and another group of scholars said \"A woman can travel alone if the road was safe\" and this is what ibn Muflih(رحمه الله) mentions from Shaykh al-Islām ibn Taymiyyâh(رحمه الله), ",
  "hajjA1par3": "but what is present in the Fatāwâh(of ibn Taymiyyâh) is that the woman doesn't travel to Hajj, except with friends or Mahrams, so what's clear from this is that Shaykh al-Islām ibn Taymiyyâh(رحمه الله) permits a woman to travel without a Mahram if she was with trustworthy friends Yaani trustworthy women, and the proof of this saying is what is mentioned in Sahīh al-Bukhārî Mu'allâqâ that 'Omar ibn al-Khattâb(رضي الله عنه ) in the final Hajj he made, gave permission to the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) to perform Hajj, so he sent with them 'Uthmân ibn 'Affān( هللا رضي )عنه and 'Abdûl al-Rahmân ibn 'Âwf(رضي الله عنه ), so they(the scholars of this view) said \"this is a consensus of the Sahābah of the permissibility of a woman travelling without a Mahram if she was with trustworthy women and the road was safe\". ",
  "hajjA1par4": "And we could respond against this by saying that the wording of the Prophet(ﷺ) is explicit in this issue \"A woman does not travel except with a Mahrâm\" and this hadīth is Agreed upon [in it's authenticity], and he made his saying a general one, and numerous narrations have been mentioned regarding travelling, so a narration came from Abū Hurayrâh(رضي الله عنه ) in Sahîh Muslîm \"It's not permissible for a woman who believes in Allâh & the last day to go travelling for 3 days or more\" and it's mentioned in Sahîh Muslîm from the Hadīth of Abū Hurayrâh \"one night\" and it's also mentioned in the Sahīhayn [Bukhārī & Muslim] from the Hadith of Abū Hurayrâh(رضي الله عنه ) \"A journey of one day & one night\" and in Sahîh al-Bukhārī from the hadīth of Abî Sa'eed(رضي الله عنه ) \"A journey of two days\" so when these narrations have differences that indicate a specific time, it's compulsory to take the unrestricted meaning [hadīths which mention no time period for the Journey - So it's harām to go travelling without a Mahram fullstop], particularly the hadīth of ibn 'Abbâs(رضي الله عنهما ) which isn't differed upon(in wordings from him).

  "hajjA1par5": "In addition to this, the Prophet(ﷺ) stated this in Hajj or in the end of his life, and it's possible that he said it in the 9th year AH in which Abū Bakr(رضي الله عنه ), 'Alī( هللا رضي )عنه and a group of Sahābah made Hajj in, so taking the unrestricted narrations which are explicit in the topic is given preference to taking the restricted narrations [that mention 1,2,3 days n.k...] that aren't explicit. Also, even if we take the restricted evidences for argument sake, no doubt Hajj takes more than 3 days, indeed Hajj exceeds more than 3 days, and it's not possible to finish Hajj in less than 3 days, so how can a woman travel this distance which would exceed 5,6 or 7 days and all the narrations do not mention anything above 3 days, rather it mentions three[days], two[days], one day & night, a journey of one day & a journey of one night.

  "hajjA1par6": "Also the reply to the actions of the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) is that this was an Ijtihād(educated guess) from them, and it could also be said that most of the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) had Mahrams, Hafsâ(رضي الله عنها) in particular & others, except that this might be opposed/rejected for Safiyyâh(رضي الله عنها), so it could be said that the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) are unlawful to be married, so it's not possible that anyone would have temptations/desires for them, and neither would they tempt the men, so it's as if their situation is less than others, especially since they made Hajj with 'Abdûl Rahmân ibn 'Âwf(رضي الله عنه ) and with 'Uthmân ibn 'Affān(رضي الله عنه ) and with the Major companions, and they would look after them more than they would look after their own daughters.",
  "hajjA1par7": "In addition to this is that the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) are the mothers of the believers, so these things(going to Hajj without a Mahrâm) could be justifiable for their actions, unlike other than them with the amount of corrupted ones, and perversion in the society, and Fitan(temptations), and being subjected to aggressors/attackers, and this is in particular with the presence of an explicit text \"A woman cannot travel except with a Mahrâm\", however what must be payed attention to, is that whoever permitted a woman to travel with trustworthy women in Hajj & 'Umrâh, do not permit this in every situation, and isn't permitted in every travel. What has been permitted from these Scholars is restricted to certain circumstances: ",
  "hajjA1par8": "1. A kāfirah(disbeliever) that reverts to Islām in dār al-Harb, it's permissible for her to travel alone to the land of the muslims.\n2.

If the woman & her friend separate from each other, she can befriend other than her if she was trustworthy/secure, or else she can travel on her own [Till she reaches her destination]. ",
  "hajjA1par9": "And it could also be said that the travelling of a woman without a Mahrâm has situations:\n1. That she travels on her own without the road being safe, then this travelling is harām by consensus, regardless if the travelling was for Hajj or 'Umrâh or for other than that.\n2. That she travels on her own & she is secure/safe on the road, then this is harām according to the Jumhūr [The majority of the Scholars]\n3. That she travels alone with a group of trustworthy women, and this has been permitted by a group of scholars in Hajj and 'Umrâh, and as we have previously stated, it has been mentioned in Bukhārī Mu'allâqa from the chain of Ibrāhīm from his father from his grandfather who said \"Omar ibn al-Khattâb(رضي الله عنه ) in the final Hajj he made, gave permission to the wives of the Prophet(ﷺ) to perform Hajj, so he sent with them 'Uthmân ibn 'Affān(رضي الله عنه ) and 'Abdûl al-Rahmân ibn 'Âwf(عنه هللا \")رضي ",

Don’t lose and then regret you didn’t take full advantage of the opportunity, most importantly do not restrict your duah, nothing is too much or too great for Allah to bestow and grant! This is the time to secure your future, build your hereafter by imploring Him and get forgiven for your past. This is a generous day in which Allah forgives left, right and centre.",
  "hajjSub11Par4": "It is important to note that duah on the day of ‘Arafah is for everything that you want and need, it is not what has been written in the books!\n\nThen after you will offer the Dhur prayer and Asr prayer COMBINED and SHORTENED wherever you stand in ‘Arafah - but make sure you are standing in ‘Arafah and not the outskirts. The prophet said ‘any place in ‘Arafah your ritual’s accepted.’\n\nThe prophet(ﷺ) said “The Hajj is ‘Arafah.”\n",
  "hajjSub11Par5": "You will stay in ‘Arafah making duah until sunset (not congregational as some do). The best duah is that which you ask Allah with complete sincerity, from the bottom of your heart, acknowledging that none can answer you except Allah the AlMighty.\n\nOn this day Allah will boast to His angels, He will proudly speak about His slaves who came to Hajj. He will boast to the angels ‘just look at My slaves! They have come to Me with disheveled hair and covered in dust!’ Why? Because you endured all of that for His sake, Allah is so proud of you that He is boasting to His angels about you... your reward is with Him alone!",
  "hajjSub12Par1": "Then you will leave for Muzdalifah, you will offer the Maghrib and Isha prayer there shortened and combined. Make a lot of duah there, glorification of Allah, whatever you can and get some rest. But your main focus should be duah, to implore Allah of your wants and needs.",

We urge that if one is capable and fit enough to walk back then they should avoid the fighting, pushing, arguments n.k. which takes place for transportation and walk back. Don’t risk invalidating your Hajj - the walk back is possible. After you have returned back to Mina you will start preparation to go and stone the Jamaraat (Jamaraat Al ‘Aqabah).",

On this day you will be stoning the big structure only. You go there and throw seven stones, each time you throw one you should throw with your right hand and say ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ - Allah is the greatest. Duah is not required here after stoning, you sacrifice your sheep, you go back to Mina and you shorten/shave your hair. Now you are absolved from the restrictions placed upon you from ihram except for sexual intercourse with your spouse (minor absolvement).",

But this time you will stone all three structures, the small one, the medium one and the big one, seven stones for each structure, you throw with your right hand and each time you say ‘Allah Hu Akbar.’ However this one you do after Zawwal, after Dhur time has come in. After the prophet stoned the second (medium) structure, he faced Makkah, raised his hands and made duah, and he did the same after stoning the third (small) structure too. You make duah for whatever you want and whatever you need, nothing is too much or too great for Allah to give or grant.",

But if you stay three days then you repeat the process of stoning all three structures again on the following (third) day.

  "hajjSub13Par6": "Note: The Shaaytan is NOT really there, you are not really stoning the devil so please refrain from getting extremely emotional or angry.

Ibrahim stoned the shaaytan and the shaaytan ran away. That’s why we relive the ritual of Ibrahim. It is a reminder that we should be like Ibrahim and not listen to the whisperings of the shaaytan, to pay no attention to shaaytan and follow the commands of Allah no matter what.",
  "hajjSub13Par8": "Due to Ibrahim’s obedience to Allah and patience as well as Isma’eel’s acceptance of Allah’s command and patience, Allah replaced the order of sacrificing Isma’eel with a ram.

However if you cannot touch it then there’s no problem - you continue to go around the Ka’bah like normal.\n• Walking around the Ka’bah seven times = one tawaaf\n• Tawaaf is just like the prayer, the only difference is you are allowed to speak during your circumambulation - make duah for whatever you want and need when going around - duah is not restricted to what’s written in the books.\n• Do not make supplication out loud and disturb other worshippers, Allah can hear you.",
  "hajjSub14Par12": "After you have performed tawaaf you go and offer two units of prayer - if you can behind Makam E Ibrahim (although these two units can be prayed anywhere in the masjid, even outside). In the first unit you recite with Al-Faatiha and Surat Al-Kafiroon and in the second unit you recite with Al-Faatiha and Surat Al-Ikhlaas if you can, however to recite using these verses is a sunnah, if you don’t know them or you forget, whatever you know/have memorised is sufficient.",

It is the end for your ritual act. You start your tawaaf from the Hajr Al-Aswad also known as the black stone. If you can kiss the stone then okay, if you cannot then you raise the right hand and say ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ from where you are as the prophet did. If it is crowded, do not push and hurt people especially just to get to the black stone, it is sufficient to raise the hand and say ‘Allah Hu Akbar.’",
  "hajjSub14Par3": "When you get to the Yemeni corner (Al-Rukn Al-Yamaani), in between the Yemeni corner stone and the black stone (see page ‘a detailed illustration of the Ka’bah’ for illustration) you are required to say (as many times as you can):",

When the water gushed out Hajr wanted to contain the water and not let it leave, so she said ‘don’t spread, don’t spread’, and so came about the name ZamZam. Allah rewarded Hajr when Allah ordered Ibrahim to leave Hajr and her infant Isma’eel in a desert in which nothing existed except a black stone, no birds, no life, completely empty. Due to her patience and trust in Allah, Allah blessed her and her infant with the miraculous water of ZamZam. Which later attracted life such as birds and the tribe of Jurhoom to settle in the area. Since that time all the way still now, Allah honoured Hajr by having people from all over of every kind to gather together in Makkah and perform Sa’i.

In addition to that, it must be done accordingly. ",

Nabii wako anasema \"Dunyâ ni gereza la muumini, na  Jannâh kwa Kāfir\", kwa hivyo tuko ndani ya Jannâh sasa hivi, na wewe uko gerezani gani? Kwa hivyo Ibn Hajr(رحمه الله) akamwambia: Uko ndani ya Jannâh kwa yale ambayo Allāh amekuandalia adhabu ya Akhera ikiwa utakufa juu ya Kufr[ukafiri]\n, na mimi niko gerezani kwa kile ambacho Allāh Ametuandalia utulivu/raha ikiwa tutakufa tukiwa waislāmu.

Na hii ni wazi, yeyote anayeshikilia[kutaka msaada kwa] kitu chochote kisicho kuwa Allāh basi amefanya Shirk, na hirizi ni marufuku kabisa, hata ikiwa ni Qur'ān kwa sababu  Qur'ān hutumiwa kwa Ruqya, sio hirizi.",

And I do not know anyone from the scholars who prohibited or disliked that. Besides that some of the Fuqahā' disliked a woman to arouse her husband during menses, so that he doesn't fall into sin from doing anything further. [Note: You can do everything together, except Jimā']\nAnd some of the layman can mix up the ruling of this issue with the ruling of divorce during menses, however there isn't any correlation between the two matters.",
  "marriageA2Par2": "So the marriage contract while she's menstruating is permissible by the agreement of the scholars, and divorcing her during her menses is harām by the agreement of the scholars.\nAnd there are 2 sayings whether the divorce takes place or not (during her menses):\n\n1. That it occurs with it being harām and this is the saying of the 4 Imāms and the majority of the scholars.\n2. That it doesn't occur, which is the madhab of the Dhāhiriyyâh which was supported by Shaykh al-Islām ibn Taymiyyâh(رحمه الله) and ibn al-Qayyîm(رحمه الله).",

And the Mawqūf reports to ibn 'Omar(رضي الله عنهما) are contradictory and most of it isn't authentic, with the chances that it's referring to the latter view [the hadīths show that divorce doesn't occur], and Allâh(جل وعال ) knows best.",
  "marriageA3Par1": "I_Asked_My_Father - Regarding looking at one's fiancée, and what's permissible to be looked at?? \nShaykh Sulaymān al-'Alwān(حفظه الله) alijibu kwa kusema: \nThe scholars do not differ regarding the permissibility of looking at one's fiancée, so he can look at whatever meets the need for attraction without being alone with the woman, and there's no disagreement that he can look at the face, but what's beyond that is differed upon, and what's correct is that he can look at what encourages him to marry her, of the face, hands, body and what a woman normally wears in her home in the presence of Women & Mahrams. \n~ The Questioner is 'Abdûl Malik al-'Alwān, the son of the Shaykh.",
  "marriageA4Par1": "The Shaykh alijibu kwa kusema: There's no difference of opinion between the scholars that the virgin girl who isn't married, if she produces milk and breastfeeds with it, then that would cause them to become Mahrams, so the breastfed[child] will become her son, and he doesn't have a father, and ibn al-Mundhir(رضي الله عنه) in \"al-Ijmā\", ibn Qudāmah(رضي الله عنه) in \"al-Mughnī\" & others have alluded to this issue.",
  "marriageA5Par1": "A man has no right to remain absent from his wife without a legitimate excuse, merely because he wants to earn a living. If the period is so long that it brings harm to the woman, then it is not permissible for him to do that. The most he can remain absent from her is between four to six months; because Allāh the Almighty has set the limit for those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives to four months. Allāh the Almighty said: \n{marriageAya}\n“Those who take an oath not to have sexual relation with their wives must wait four months, then if they return (change their idea in this period), verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Sūrah Al-Baqarah 226]",
  "marriageA5Par2": "Similarly, there is a report from ‘Umar -although the chain is disconnected- that he allowed the Muslim soldiers to remain absent for six months. So anything longer than that must be agreed by the spouses. The husband should come to an agreement with his wife on a period of time that he is able to maintain, and the wife should cooperate with her husband as much as she can just as the husband should be kind to his wife as much as he can. And Allāh is the One Whose help is sought. ",
  "marriageA6Par1": " He who is intimate with his wife whilst she is on her menstrual cycle without knowing about the presence of menstrual blood, there is no sin upon him. However, it is obligatory upon him to make an expiation; and this is by giving away in charity one Dīnār or a half of it in gold (or its equivalent in currency). This is due to the generality of the statement of the prophet: \n{marriageHadith}\nHe who is intimate with his wife whilst she is on her menstrual cycle let him give a Dīnār or a half of it in charity. (Reported by Ahmad and the four Sunan compilers with a Sahīh chain of narration)",
  "marriageA6Par2": "It is obligatory upon the menstruating woman to inform her husband that she is on her menstrual cycle. And Allāh is the Granter of Success. May prayers and peace from Allāh be upon our prophet and his family.",
  "marriageA7Par1": "That is not permissible, unless she is severely harmed due to becoming pregnant; harm that is beyond the norm amongst pregnant women. If so, it is not permissible for the husband to prevent her from protecting herself from this severe harm by way of that which is less harmful (Yaani consuming these pills) due to the statement of the Prophet ﷺ ((There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm))\nAnd the statement of Allāh the Majestic and Exalted: \n{marriageAya}\n“Allāh wants for you ease and doesn't want for you difficulty.” ",

All the acts that are specific to Allah(سبحانه وتعالى)  alone which no-one should ascribe to other than Allah(سبحانه وتعالى) : not to an angel or messenger. For instance, only Allah(سبحانه وتعالى)  can create from non-existence and can provide from nothingness. Only Allah(سبحانه وتعالى)  can give life, death, benefits or harm, arranges every affair from the heavens to the earth, manages the universe and also legislates.",
  "monotheistPar10": "The belief in Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) is the second pillar of Tawheed. This pillar cannot be fulfilled until the person asserts Allah(سبحانه وتعالى )'s oneness and worships Him by belief, tongue and action. So if any of these requirements are violated, then the individuals' belief in Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) is insufficient.",
  "monotheistPar11": "Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab also said (regarding this): “There is no disagreement within the Muslim Ummah that Tawheed is by heart- which is knowledge, by tongue- which is verbal declaration, and by action- which is implementing what Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) orders and forbids, so if any of these are violated, the person cannot be regarded as a Muslim. And if the individual acknowledges Tawheed and does not implement it, he is an obstinate Kafir (disbeliever) like iblis (Shaitan) and Fi’raun, or if he implements Tawheed without believing in it, he is a pure Munafiq (hypocrite) who is worse than a Kafir.”",
  "monotheistPar12": "Abdullah ibn AbdurRahman Aba Battin said:\n“When the Muslim knows the greatness of the Shahaadah and its requirements and this should be by belief with the heart, articulation with the tongue and action with the limbs. So if one of these requirements is not met, the person is not regarded as a Muslim- as Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) has mentioned and explained this in His Book(Quran). If a person was a Muslim implementing all the pillars of his Deen, then he said or did anything that contradicts the Shahaadah, all that he did would not benefit him as Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) said about those who talked about the Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) after the battle of Tabuk:",

  "monotheistPar14": "“They swear by Allah that they said nothing (bad), but really they said a word of disbelief, and they disbelieved after accepting Islam, and they resolved with that which they were unable to carry out, and they could not find any cause to do so except that Allah and His Messenger had enriched them of His Bounty. If then they will repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful torment in this wordly life and in the Hereafter.

For example some of Allah(سبحانه وتعالى) ’s names are “Allah”, “Al Ahad”(the One), “As Samad” (the Self-sufficient), “Ar Rahman” (the Beneficient), Al Kadoos (the Holy) and others. As for the attributes, Allah(سبحانه وتعالى)  is omnipotent, omniscient and that He Alone Hears everything remote or near, along with other attributes that are specific for Him Alone.",
  "monotheistPar3": "3. All the acts of worship that should be directed to Him Alone because it is He Who Created and provided us and gives us life and causes us to die. Allah(سبحانه وتعالى)  says in Sūrah 30, Ayah 40: \n“Allah is He Who Created you, then provided food for you, then will cause you to die then (again) He will give you life (on the day of Resurrection). Is there any of your partners that do anything of that? Glory is to Him! And Exalted is He above all that they associate.”",
  "monotheistPar4": "Allah(سبحانه وتعالى) also says in Sūrah 2, Ayah 21:\n“O mankind! Worship your Lord Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become Al-Muttaqun.”",
  "monotheistPar5": "And in a Hadith reported by both Bukhari and Muslim Muaad ibn Jabal (رضي الله عنه) said, “ I was riding a donkey behind the Prophet (ﷺ) then he said “ O Muaad- Do you know the right of Allah on his slaves and the right of the slaves on Allah. Muaad said “Allah and His Messenger know best. He (ﷺ) said the right of Allah on His slaves is that they should worship Him and not ascribe partners with Him, and the right of the slaves on Allah is not to punish anyone who does not commit shirk. He (Muaad) said, “shall I tell people the good news” He (ﷺ) said “ Don’t do so lest they settle on this.”",
  "monotheistPar6": "And among these acts of worship are invocation, bowing, prostration, love, exaltation, fear, hope, repentance, submissiveness, reliance, vowing, sacrifice, asking for help and going to for judgment. So if anyone directs any of these acts to other than Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ), he becomes a Mushrik, even if he prays, fasts, goes to Hajj and claims to be a Muslim.",
  "monotheistPar7": "Secondly, a person should assert Allah ﷻ's Oneness and worships Him by belief, tongue, and action, because worshipping Allah is based on two main pillars; the disbelief in Taghut and belief in Allah (سبحانه وتعالى ).",
  "monotheistPar8": "The disbelief in Taghut is the first pillar of Tawheed and this pillar cannot be fulfilled until the person rejects the Taghut by belief, tongue, and action, so if one of these requirements is violated, then the person cannot be regarded as a disbeliever in Taghut. For instance, if a person believes that Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) Alone is Al-Hakim (the Legislator) and declares this with his tongue, but later commits Kufr by appointing someone in a legislative authority which reserves the absolute right to legislate, then this person has committed Shirk by ascribing an act which is specific to Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) Alone to other than Allah.",
  "monotheistPar9": "Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab said: “So know that the Deen of Allah(سبحانه وتعالى ) is in the heart in terms of belief, love and hatred, and in the tongue in terms of verbally pronouncing the shahaadah, and in the limbs in terms of implementing the pillars of Islam and avoiding actions which drive out of Islam. Therefore if any of these requirements are violated, the person becomes Kafir or Murtad (apostate).”",

It is therefore very important to know that Tawheed has some Nawaquid, which nullify one’s Islam. For example in Salah (prayer), there are many factors that invalidate it, for instance if a person laughs, eats or drinks while praying- his prayer is invalid. So if a Muslim commits any of the things that nullify Tawheed, then he becomes a Murtad, Mushrik and Kafir.",
  "nullifiersPar1": "Know, that the nullifiers of Islam are ten:\nFirst: Shirk in the worship of Allah. He (سبحانه وتعالى ) said, “Verily, Allah does not forgive shirk, but He forgives What He wills that is less than that.” And He (سبحانه وتعالى ) said, “Verily, whoever commits shirk with Allah, then Allah has made Jannah haram for him, and his abode is the Fire. And there are no helpers for the dhalimin.” And from it (shirk) is to slaughter for other than Allah, such as one who slaughters for the jinn or for a grave.",
  "nullifiersPar10": "Tenth: Turning away from the Din of Allah (سبحانه وتعالى ), not learning it nor acting upon it. And the proof is His (سبحانه وتعالى ) saying, “And who is more unjust than the one who is reminded of the ayat of his Lord; then he turns away from them?”",
  "nullifiersPar11": "There is no difference in any of these nullifiers between the one who did them in jest, intentionally, and the one who did them out of fear; except for the mukrah. All of them are from the most dangerous matters and the most common to occur. Thus, it is befitting for the Muslim to be warned of them and fear falling into any of them. We seek refuge with Allah from things that bring about His anger and severe punishment. May the salah and salam be upon His best creation Muhammad, his family, and his companions.",
  "nullifiersPar2": "Second: Whoever places between him and Allah intermediaries, making du‘a to them, seeking their intercession, and placing his trust in them, has disbelieved according to consensus.",
  "nullifiersPar3": "Third: Whoever does not make takfir of the mushrikin, or doubts their kufr, or thinks that their mathhab is ok disbelieves.",

  "nullifiersPar6": "Sixth: Whoever mocks something from the din of the Messenger or the rewards of Allah or His punishment disbelieves. And the proof for that is His (سبحانه وتعالى ) saying, “Is it Allah, His ayat, and His messenger that you were mocking? Make no excuse, verily you have disbelieved after your iman.”",
  "nullifiersPar7": "Seventh: Sihr (magic), such as sarf and ‘atf; so whoever practices it or is pleased with it disbelieves.",

  "prayerA18Par1": "Shaykh Sulaymān al-'Alwān(حفظه الله ) alijibu kwa kusema: Following the Mu'adhin is a recommended Sunnâh according to the Majority of the Scholars, and it is said that it's Compulsory, which was mentioned by Abū Yūsuf(رحمه الله ) & a group of Scholars, the Prophet(ﷺ) said: \"If the Mu'adhin makes the call to prayer, then say what he says\" [Sahīh al-Bukhārī(611) and Sahīh Muslim(383).]. Its authenticity is agreed upon.",
  "prayerA19Par1": "It also includes hail and snowfall. In the collections of Bukhārī and Muslim on the authority of 'Abdullāh ibn 'Umar may Allāh be pleased with them both - that the Prophet ﷺ would instruct the mu'addhin on cold, windy, or rainy nights to announce to the people: 'pray in your homes'.",
  "prayerA19Par2": "He narrated that from the Prophet ﷺ, and he mentioned alongside rain, cold and windy weather. That is; strong winds and severe cold take the same ruling.",
  "prayerA1Par1": "If a person catches a Rak'ah with the Mutim [a person praying a complete Salāh], this is more general than [saying] Muqīm [a Resider], regardless if he was a Resider or not, however he completed[his Salāh], because sometimes a traveller can perform ta'wīl [an interpretation], so he prays completely [without shortening], so upon this we say if the traveller catches a Rak'ah or more [rak'ahs] behind a Mutim, we do not conditions this to praying behind a Traveller as What ibn Mas'َud﴾رحمه الله﴿ did, ibn Mas'َud﴾رحمه الله﴿ wa a traveller and would pray behind Uthmān ﴾رحمه الله﴿, and Uthmān﴾رحمه الله﴿ was a traveller, however he performed ta'wīl [interpretation] that he's a Muqīm [Resider], so Uthmān ﴾رحمه الله﴿ completed the full Salāh & ibn Mas'َud﴾رحمه الله﴿ completed the Salāh behind him & he wouldn't shorten it, so in this situation, it is compulsory upon you to  complete your Salāh and this is the saying of Majority of Scholars, from the Sahābah such as ibn Mas'َud﴾رحمه الله﴿, ibn 'Omar﴾رحمه الله عنهما﴿, ibn 'Abbās ﴾رحمه الله عنهما﴿, and from among the Tābi'een and from the Imāms that are followed after them, and this is What's correct in this issue.",
  "prayerA1Par2": "However, if he [the traveller] enters/catches the Salāh outside the Rak'ah, such as the one who enters in the final Tashahhَud, so what's the correct in this situation is that he prays the Salāh of a traveller, not the Salāh of a resider, because he did not follow any part of the Salāh, and the Salāh is known by catching a Rak'ah, because of the saying of the Prophet ﷺ “Whoever catches a Rak'ah of Salāh, then he has caught the Salāh” and the proof this is also, “an opposing evidence” [daleel 'aks] as it's known by the Usَuliyeen [Scholars of Usَul al—Fiqh], and it's the issue of Salāh al—Jum'ah.",
  "prayerA1Par3": "If he joins in where the Imām is in the final Tashahَud of the Salāh, how would he pray? He would pray 4[Rak'ahs for Jum'ah], and if he prays a Rak'ah [with Imām], he prays 2 Rak'ahs [for Jum'ah], so that has proved that [the Salāh] is known by Rukَu', and this is a proof against Abَu Abَu Hanīfah﴾رحمه الله﴿ when he said that if joins in the final Tashahhَud with the Imām, that he prays the same as him, and he will be in the of following the Salāh, and when he was given the evidences regarding Jum'ah, he contradicted himself and didn't say anything regarding Jum'ah, and he said it for other Salāh [other that Jum'ah], so this is a proof against him in this issue. So whats correct in this issue is that if the Traveller prays a Rak'ah with the Mutim [the one who completes Salāh], he prays the Salāh of a Mutim, and if he joins in besides the Rak'ah [like in the final tashahhَud], the he prays the Salāh of a traveller.",
  "prayerA1Par4": "Note: Daleel 'Aksi according to the scholars of Usَul al—Fiqh means that if the Prophet peace be upon him said the optional prayers in the night are by two's [i.e Two Rak'ahs], therefore we understand from this that the optional prayers of the day are by 4's, so you pray 4 Rak'ah before Dhuhr and 'Asr. Btw there's difference of opinion regarding praying 4 Rak'ahs with 1 Salām, but the correct opinion is that it's correct & perfectly fine.",
  "prayerA20Par1": "Yes, the jamā'ah should still be established for whoever attends. However, it isn't wājib to do so, as this concession applies to all; if everyone was to take the concession and not attend the congregation, there is nothing wrong with this and no one would be sinful. With that said, it is still better for the congregation to be established, to accommodate for whoever is able to attend.",
  "prayerA21Par1": "The time of ‘isha begins with the disappearance of the red afterglow, and it is the redness which is spread out in the sky after the setting of the sun. As for the time in which salat-ul-‘isha ends, then the people of knowledge have differed regarding it, there are two views:",
  "prayerA21Par2": "The first view: is that it extends up until salat-ul-fajr, due to the generality of the hadith of Abu Qatadah in Muslim that Rasulullah(ﷺ) said: “...indeed there is no neglect in sleep, indeed neglect is only upon the one who didn't perform the prayer until the time of the next prayer arrived.”",
  "prayerA21Par3": "The second view: is that it extends until half of the night has passed, due to the hadith of Jibril narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdillah, and he mentioned therein: “...then he came to him for ‘isha, when half of the night had passed...”, or he said “a third of the night”, “...so he prayed ‘isha...”",
  "prayerA21Par4": "And the most correct is the second view, that it ends when half of the night has passed, because of the hadith of Jibril which has preceded, as it is a specification of the generality of the hadith of Abu Qatadah.\nAnd Allah (سبحانه وتعالى ) knows best.",
  "prayerA22Par1": "Sujûd as-sahw is legislated in the voluntary prayer, just as it is legislated in the obligatory [prayer], because there is no specific [proof to restrict it to the obligatory prayers], but the people of knowledge differed, between it being recommended or obligatory, and Allâh knows best.",
  "prayerA23Par1": "It should be known that completing the rows in congregational prayer is an obligation. It has been narrated in the Musnad and the Sunnan that the Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw a man praying alone behind the row so he waited until the man completed, so the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Repeat your prayer; there is no prayer for the man who stands alone behind the row” [Musnad of Imâm Ahmad]",
  "prayerA23Par2": "And a number of People of Knowledge held this hadith on its apparent meaning, so they said that the prayer is invalid for the one who prays alone behind the rows, but the most evident in his saying: “no prayer” is the completeness not the correctness, meaning the prayer is not complete, and this is indicated by a hadith of Abu Bakrah when he bowed without the joining the row as in Sahih Al-Bukhari.",
  "prayerA23Par3": "And the command of the Prophet (ﷺ) to repeat the prayer was to show the importance of the matter and this applies when there is a gap in the row but if the row is complete and he did not find a place in it, then there is nothing wrong with praying alone behind the rows.",
  "prayerA23Par4": "And it is not said that he pulls a man from the front rows to pray with him, as for this saying, although some scholars hold this view but it is not good. Because doing so  creates a gap in the front row and further it is injustice for the one who came earlier caused by the one who came late. \nAnd Allah, the Most High, Knows Best.",
  "prayerA24Par1": "No it is not allowed because he will explain and make exegesis (Tafsīr) of the Qur'an with his deviance. The Qur’an is the word of Allah, the entire religion is from the Qur’an, if you are not firmly established on it, you will fall into his deviance.  The righteous predecessors of this Ummah said: This knowledge is the religion, so look at and be careful who you take your knowledge and religion from!",
  "prayerA24Par2": "Imaam Maalik رحمه الله said, there are four categories of people you cannot take your knowledge from them:\n1) A foolish man who doesn't care about his foolishness - even if he is the most knowledgeable - do not learn from him.\n2) An innovator who guides people to his innovation.\n3) Whosoever continuously lies/the habitual liar, he is a well known liar to the people, even if he's not lying with the Prophet's ahadith he cannot be trusted or learnt from.\n4) A righteous worshipper who is not memorising what he's saying Yaani, does not know what he's talking about regarding Quran and Sunnah, he is ignorant, being righteous is not a sign of possessing knowledge of the religion and its rules. He considers himself knowledgeable but he could not be further away from the truth. We see this category prominently today especially online.",
  "prayerA24Par3": "I want to take Imaam Maalik’s statement and add one more category to it:\n5) The one who teaches people but he doesn't know what he's talking about. The people who are doubtfully guessing at the unknown. Allah said (Interpretation of the meaning), do not say that which you have no proof of from Quran and Sunnah, without knowledge.\n\nFirst learn. Teaching without knowledge harms the people more than it benefits them.",
  "prayerA25Par1": "Masbahah or Subhah (prayer beads) were (prevalent) with the Buddhists and the Hindus, then it became (prevalent) with Christians, then it entered among the Muslims, so a number of the people of knowledge viewed its permissibility, and even authored (books) regarding that, just as As-Suyuti did where he composed «Al-Minhah fi as-Subhah».",
  "prayerA25Par2": "And likewise did his student Ibn Tulun, who composed «Al-Mulhah fi ma warada fi asl as-Subhah», and the most extensive from those who authored upon their approach was Abd al-Hayy al-Laknawi, where he authored «Nuzha al-Fikr fi Subhah ad-dhikr» and the truth, is that the truth is far removed from those who have inclined to it (beads being permitted).",
  "prayerA25Par3": "As for what was mentioned of the ahadith regarding their validity, then nothing from them is authentic, rather it was reported from the companions, (may Allah the Blessed and Exalted be pleased with them), that they forbade doing tasbih with them.",
  "prayerA25Par4": "On the authority of al-Salt ibn Bahraam, who said: “′Ibn Mas′ud passed by a woman who had a [masbahah] with which she was making tasbeeh, so he broke it and threw it aside, then he passed by a man who was making tasbeeh with pebbles, and he kicked him then said, ‘you have committed an unjust bid′ah, or (else) you have outdone the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ) in knowledge!’” Narrated by Ibn Waddah in Al-Bid′i wa an-Nahyi ′anha.",
  "prayerA25Par5": "And there are more narrations from Ibn Mas`ud and others (may Allah be pleased with them). So the basic principle is that it is sufficient for a person to do tasbih and dhikr with his fingertips, because they will be made to speak (testifying on the day of judgement), and whoever has difficulty in counting (on fingertips) then some of the people of knowledge, such as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may the mercy of Allah be on him) and others, have allowed him to do so (i.e count on prayer beads). \nAnd Allah knows best.",
  "prayerA26Par1": "This situation should be avoided all together, especially with the large quantity of segregation facilities available (and it being better for women to pray at home). However, in a situation where this can't be avoided, it is still not permissible for a woman to pray sitting down using this as an excuse, standing for the prayer is a rukn and a rukn cannot be dropped by something like that. Even though men can see the women she should to her part such as fulfilling the conditions of the hijab (for example, her clothing should be loose).",
  "prayerA26Par2": "During the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) the women used to offer prayer behind the men. In the Masjid it was the Imaam, next rows would be the men, the row after that would be the children and the back rows would be the women, of course you would get on occasions some Sahabah would end up coming to the prayer late, that doesn't mean that the female companion's of the Prophet would offer prayer sitting down due to it, they would continue their prayer as normal.",
  "prayerA26Par3": "Rukn can only be dropped with certain legitimate reasons such as sickness, illness, but an excuse like this is not legitimate to have the rukn drop as the women should be offering prayer in loose clothing and clothing which makes them unknown, it should be like an armour concealing her, it should not be exposing anything of hers - even her length or width! It is for this reason therefore that she must stand and prostrate even if she is offering in such a situation.",
  "prayerA2Par1": "Imām ibn al-Mundhir(رحمه الله) mentioned in his book \"Al-Ijmā'\" that the Scholars have agreed that if the women followed the Imām & prayed with him, that is sufficient for them. And if she catch a Rak'ah from Salāt al-Jum'ah, then she will pray on top of that And if she catch a Rak'ah from Salāt al-Jum'ah, then she will pray on top of that  her home, then she should pray 4[Rak'ahs]. And it's narrated from the authority of 'Abdullâh ibn Mas'ūd( عنه هللا ضي ر ) and ibn 'Omar( رضي عنهما )هللا that they said: \"If she caught a Rak'ah from Jum'ah, then she should complete the other[Rak'ah], and if she caught them sitting[Yaani Entered in Tashahhûd], she should pray 4[Rak'ahs].\"",
  "prayerA2Par2": "And Imām ibn al-Mundhir(رحمه الله) mentioned a Consensus that whoever misses Jum'ah from the Residers, that they should pray 4 Rak'ahs. And it's narrated from Abī Hanīfah(رحمه الله) and a group of scholars that if he entered into the Jum'ah prayer before the Imām gives Salāms, then he should pray 2 Rak'ahs, and if he did not follow the Imām in his Salāh, then he should pray 4 Rak'ahs by the agreement of the scholars.",
  "prayerA2Par3": "Note: The view of Imām Abū Hanīfah(رحمه الله) is weak, as Shaykh Sulaymān al-'Alwān( حفظه )هللا mentioned elsewhere. Because the Prophet(ﷺ) said \"Whoever catches a rak'ah of Salâh, then he has caught the Salâh\" so if you entered in the Tashahhûd, you should pray 4 Rak'ahs, not 2, because you haven't caught the Salâh اعلم وهللا ",
  "prayerA3Par1": "If he repented, he should ask Allāh for forgiveness, and increase in his obedience and seeking of forgiveness, and to draw himself closer to Allāh(جل وعﻻ) what he is able too, so this can be an expiration of what has passed, and there's no need for him to repeat what was missed from the prayers, and if he made Hajj, there's no need to repeat his hajj, or repeat his fast or other than that, but rather if he repents in the time of dhuhr, he would pray salāt al-Dhuhr, and if he repented after 'Asr, he would pray Dhuhr and 'Asr according to the view of majority, if he repented after 'ishā, he would pray Maghrib and 'ishā, according to the view of Majority, and does he renew his marriage contract? What's correct: That he doesn't renew his marriage contract, because there is no proof of this.",
  "prayerA4Par1": "We would say, did he pray at Hajj or not? If he prayed at Hajj, then he has entered to Islām and became a Muslim and his Hajj is Valid. And if he abandoned Salāh afterwards, we would call him a disbeliever, however if the returns back to Islām, his deed would return back to him. This is according to the most correct opinion amongst the scholars. because Allāh(جل وعﻻ) said: “And whoever of you turns away from his religion (to disbelief) and dies while being a disbeliever”  The meaning of this 'Ayah if he returns back to Islām, his deeds will be returned back to him, and the deeds aren't nullified except if he died upon disbelief, and this is one of the two sayings from Imām Ahmad ﴾رحمه الله﴿ and that was chosen by Shaykh al—Islām ibn Taymiyyāh﴾رحمه الله﴿.

  "prayerA5Par1": "If it's proven that he's not ignorant, and I believe that the abandoner of Salāh is a Kāfir, and you showed him the ruling and he refused to abandon it, then there's no prevention from calling him a Kāfir if it's proven to the person with absolute proof, and the people of knowledge differentiate between ruling upon the individual and between ruling upon in general, so Ahlal Sunnāh rule upon generally and do not rule upon the individual, until the conditions have been met and the preventions(of takfeer) have been removed, so if the conditions have been met in this issue and the preventions(of takfeer) have been removed, and the person views that the abandoner of Salāh is a Kāfir, then there's no prevention from ruling upon this man that he's a Kāfir, knowing that he doesn't pray and views the abandoner of Salāh as a Kāfir.

That it's obligatory & this is what's popular in the Madhab of Imām Ahmad, a narration from the Madhab of Imām Mālik(رحمه الله).\n2. That it's recommended & this is what's popular in the Madhab of Imām Abū Hanīfah, al-Shāfi'ī & Mālik, also a narration in the Hanbalī madhab as it was held by ibn Qudāmah(رحمه الله) & this is the view of the Majority of the Scholars.\n3.

It is authentic, Imām Abū Bakr ibn Abī Shaybâh(رحمه الله) said \"It has been proven to us that the Prophet(ﷺ) said it\" [Refer to al-Talkhees al-Habeer by Ibn Hajr (1/257)] and several scholars that came after him followed this.\n2. It is Hassan by supportive evidence. A group of scholars such as al-Mundhirī(رحمه الله) & ibn Kathir(رحمه الله) & others viewed that it was Hassan by strengthening the weak chains of narrations.\n3.

  "prayerA6Par5": "However Shaykh Sulaymān al-'Alwān(حفظه الله) said the Qiyās of Imām al-Bukhārī(رحمه الله) is questionable because if this was the case, then we would have to say Bismillâh before the Takbīrāt at Hajj, and before we say the Adhān, and before we say Allâhu Akbar for Salâh, however no one has said this. Also, to support the view that it's not prescribed to say Bismillâh before Wudū' is that it's not Authentic from the Prophet(ﷺ) nor the Sahābah(رضي الله عنهم) and not a single Sahābī who described the Wudū' of the Prophet(ﷺ) mentioned that he said \"Bismillâh\", but rather they mentioned things which are of less importance.

Rather, he is to be obeyed and followed. Allaah honored him with granting him the station of servitude (Yaani that he worships Allaah).

The definite article (Al) before Hamd is for including all the commendable acts He does.

Amma baada...\nNdugu wengine wema walinifikiria vizuri - wakidhani kwamba uvimbe huo ni nyama [Ujumbe wa Mchapishaji: Wakati mwana-kondoo alikuwa na uvimbe mwilini mwake, wengine wanaweza kudhani kuwa inazidi kunona na kwa hivyo itakuwa na nyama zaidi. Kwa hivyo Waarabu walikuwa wakisema huu msemo. Inaweza kumaanisha \"kupindukia,\" na yanayokaribiana(kwa maana) na hiyo kwa Kiswahili.] - kwa hivyo walinitaka niwawekee bayana mbinu ya kutafuta elimu au maarifa. Nilikuwa tayari nimeandaa rasimu ya kitabu juu ya mada hii, isipokuwa kwamba siwezi kuikamilisha kwa sasa kwa sababu ya hali ambazo hazijafichika. Kwa hivyo, nikaona niandike muhtasari wa yaliyomo, kulingana na kile kinachotoshea kwenye karatasi hii. Namuomba Allah Aifanye iwe ya faida.",
  "succinctSub10Par1": "Mwanafunzi hapaswi kutegemea alichohifadhi wakati wote, kwa sababu kuhifadhi husaliti na kile kinachohifadhiwa kinaweza kutoweka, lakini kilichoandikwa kimehifadhiwa. Kwa hivyo anapaswa kutafuta kukusanya na kufanya muhtasari wa faida na kukusanya masomo yake.",
  "succinctSub11Par1": "Kwa hivyo ni jukumu la mwanafunzi kuchukua mambo hatua kwa hatua linapokuja suala la maarifa na kujifunza kidogo kidogo, na kwamba haendi kwa jambo moja hadi lingine mpaka akolee, kwa msongamano ya sayansi katika akili mara nyingi husababisha mahali ambapo mtu hupoteza maarifa.",
  "succinctSub11Par2": "Hatua zinazojulikana za kutafuta maarifa ni tatu:\n1. Kwa waanzilishi: ni kupata uelewa wa dhana ya jumla ya mambo; hujulikana kama “hatua ya mutun. ”\nNdani yake, mwanafunzi anafahamiwa na istilahi za sayansi, mambo yake, na muundo wake, na inamlazimu mwanafunzi ajitahidi katika hatua hii kuelewa maneno na istilahi, hafai kuishughulisha akili yake kwa kuamua na kuchunguza kwa usahihi mambo hayo.\n2. Kwa hatua ya kati: ni kwa uchunguzi na ufahamu; inajulikana kama “hatua ya maelezo ya mutun.” Ndani yake, mwanafunzi huangalia mambo anuwai, uthibitisho wao, na kutofautisha ambayo ni sahihi zaidi kutoka kwake.\n3. Kwa wale ambao wameimarika: ni kwa ajili ya kupanua na ijtihad; inajulikana kama “hali ya kazi kubwa na ya kina.” Ndani yake, mwanafunzi hupanua maarifa yake katika matawi ya maarifa, na anaangalia mambo mazuri na anaangalia kwa yasiyo afikiana, n.k.\n\nKama kwa vitabu maalum kwa kila hatua, basi hii inatofautiana kulingana na wakati, mahali, madhhab, na shaykh.

Tawhid al-Asma was-Sifat: Unapaswa kuanza na kazi fupi za Shaykhul-Islam ibn Taymiyyah, kama vile: Al-Wasitiyyah na Al-Hamawiyyah, kisha At- Tadmuriyyah na maelezo ya Al-Wasitiyyah. Halafu mtu anaendelea na kazi ndefu hapa, kwa mfano, aina za imani kutoka kwa Majmu’ al-Fatawa, Dar [ at-Ta’arub al-‘Aql wan-Naql  ], As-Sawa‘iq al-Mursalah, na wengine.",
  "succinctSub11bPar1": "1. Tafsir: Ni ujuzi wa hali ya juu, na vitabu vimekamilika, hata toleo fupi la muhtasari wao. Hapa hakuna mutun.

Vitabu vya kipaombele vya tafsir ni vile vya: at-Tabari, al-Baghawi, ibn Kathir, ibn as-Sa’di, na Ad-Durr al-Manthur ya as-Suyuti.",

Kwa mwanafunzi, inamlazimu kuanza na ‘Umdah [ al-Ahkam ] kwa sababu ya ufupi wake, kisha kuendelea kwa Bulugh [ al-Maram ] au Al-Muharrar, kwa kuwa zinakaribia sawa. Baada ya hapo, mtu anapaswa kuendelea na maelezo ya vitabu hivi, kisha aje kwenye kazi ndefu, kama vile: Fath al-Bari , Sharh Muslim, Nayl al-Awtar, na vyengine.",

Kwa hivyo ni jukumu la mwanafunzi [wa maarifa], ikiwa anataka faida, kufanya masomo ya kisa na kuangalia asili ya hadith mwenyewe, na kwenda moja kwa moja kwenye vitabu vya chimbuko, wanaume wa mnyororo, na kasoro zilizofichwa.",

[Pia pana] Sharh al-Kawkab  al-Munir ya ibn an-Najjar al-Futuhi. Na nikakusanya Usul Fiqh Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah, ambayo inaweza kupatikana mtandaoni.",
  "succinctSub11ePar3": "Pili, vitabu juu ya usul ni ngumu kueleweka kwa sababu ya anuwai ya maneno ya kiufundi. Kwa hivyo, ni bora kwa anayeanza kuanza kwa kusoma kazi za wasomi wa kisasa katika sayansi hii, kwa sababu ni rahisi kuelewa na hutumia lugha rahisi. Hii ni pamoja na: Usul al-Fiqh ya Khallaf, al-Khudari, Zaydan, na wengineo. Mtu anapomaliza nazo, basi anaendelea na kazi za wasomi wa mapema.",

Halafu mtu anaendelea na maelezo yao, kisha kwa kazi ndefu kama Al-Mughni, al-Majmu’, n.k. Na kwa yule ambaye hafuati chuo chochote maalum cha ufahamu, basi kwake ni Ad-Durar al-Bahiyyah ya ash-Shawkani na maelezo yake Ar-Rawdah an-Nadiyyah ya Siddiq al-Qanuji.",

Hakuna shida kujifunza na kujua vyuo vya ufahamu na vitabu hivi. Na hapa kuna ufafanuzi wa kina ambao haufai kupitia sasa.",
  "succinctSub11fPar3": "pili, Ninapendekeza mwanafunzi [wa maarifa], baada ya kujua fiqh na usul zake, asome vitabu vya al-Fuqaha al-Ahrar (wasomi wa bure wa fiqh), wale ambao hawana zingatia kabisa vyuo fulani vya ufahamu: ibn Hazm, ibn Taymiyyah, ibnul-Qayyim, na ash-Shawkani. 3 Zinamsaidia mwanafunzi kwa kina na kuwaruhusu kukuza sehemu za ijtihad, kushikilia maandishi iliyoteremshwa kwa makini, na kuyachukua kauli za wanaume zilizo juu yao.",
  "succinctSub11gPar1": "Mwanafunzi [wa maarifa] anaanza na Al-Ajrumiyyah, akiendelea na ufafanuzi wake At-Tuhfah as-Saniyyah, alongside pamoja na vitabu vya muhtasari vya ibn Hisham, kama vile Sharh Shudhur adh-Dhahab na Sharh Qatr an-Nada, na kisha kwenye kazi zilizo na maelezo zaidi, kama vile Mughni al-Labib na maelezo juu ya Al-Alfiyyah, n.k. Kuna mambo mawili ambayo ningependa kutaja hapa:",
  "succinctSub11gPar2": "Kwanza , kuhifadhi sarufi katika nadharia haimaanishi kuwa salama kutokana na makosa ya kisarufi kwa sababu ya malezi mabovu, kwani inajulikana kuwa hata wasomi wengine wa sarufi walianguka katika makosa ya kisarufi. Na moja wapo ya njia bora za kuboresha ulimi (Yaani, matamshi yako) ni kwa mwanafunzi [wa maarifa] kusoma vitabu kadhaa na tashkil ( pamoja na harakat ), wakati anasoma harakat (alama za vokali) kwa sauti. Kila wakati anapoongeza kusoma hivi, ulimi wake utazidi kuwa ufasaha zaidi, na kwa kurudia hii, mwanafunzi [wa maarifa] anaendeleza uwezo wa asili na maarifa ya lugha ya Kiarabu, ikiwa Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) Akitaka iwe basi itawa hivyo.",
  "succinctSub11gPar3": "pili , ukamilifu wa sarufi kinadharia na kivitendo inamaanisha kuwa salama kutoka kwa makosa ya kisarufi na kujua i’rab (jinsi maneno yanapungua); haimaanishi kuwa na matamshi fasaha, onyesho zuri, na mtindo wa kuvutia. Hiyo ni hupatikana katika vitabu vya adab, sio sarufi. Kwa hivyo ikiwa mwanafunzi [wa maarifa] anataka kuboresha mtindo wake, anapaswa kuangalia vitabu vya mashairi ya Kiarabu, kazi za ufasaha, na viongozi wa hotuba nzuri. Angalao ajaribu kuhifadhi kadiri awezavyo ya mashairi na misemo ya adab; na anapaswa kurejelea vitabu vya al-insha 4 kama  Al-Mathal as-Sa’ir ya ibnul-Athir, n.k.",
  "succinctSub12Par1": "Baada ya mwanafunzi [wa maarifa] kupata uelewa wa shar’, anapaswa kupata ufahamu wa waqi’ (juu ya hali halisi ya ardhi), ili kuifunga kwa shar’ na kujua utumizi wake. Kwa hivyo yeye huangalia vyuo vya kisasa vya ufahamu kwa kuzingatia imani na nadharia, hujifunza maswala mapya ya fiqh, na anarudi kwenye vitabu vyenye ensaiklopidia mpya na anafuata matukio; lakini anahitaji kusawazishwa hapa, ili isiwe mzigo juu yake.",
  "succinctSub13Par1": "Mwanafunzi [wa maarifa] anapaswa kujitahidi kuwa thabiti katika maarifa kabla ya kujiweka tayari kwa kufundisha. Na anapaswa kuendelea kujifunza, hata baada ya kuanza kufundisha, kama Imam Ahmad alivyosema, “[Kutafuta maarifa ni] kutoka utoto hadi kaburini.”",
  "succinctSub14Par1": "Ni juu ya mwanafunzi [wa maarifa] kujipamba na adabu na adabu za kutafuta [maarifa] ndani yake na kwa walimu wake, wenzake, wanafunzi, na wengineo. Wasomi wengi wa zamani na wa sasa wameandika mengi inalifanyia kazi suala hili, kwa hivyo ni bora kuwarejelea.",
  "succinctSub14aPar1": "Hizi ni maandishi na insha ambazo ninamshauri anayetafuta maarifa kusoma, kuangalia kwa kurudia, na kurejelea kila wakati:",
  "succinctSub14aPar2": "1. Maandishi yote ya Shaykhul-Islam ibn Taymiyyah na mwanafunzi wake ibnul-Qayyim ( رحمه الله ), kwani kazi zao zinategemea uelewa wa Kitabu na Sunnah, na ndizo tegemeo kuu la mbinu ya salafi. \n2. Maandishi yote ya al-Hafidh adh-Dhahabi (رحمه الله), kama alivyo, kwa kweli, ni mtafiti wa uchunguzi.\n3. Maandishi yote ya al-Hafith ibn Rajab (رحمه الله), haswa: Fath al-Bari, Sharh al-‘Ilal, Jami’ al-‘Ulum, na Al-Qawa‘id, kwa sababu ya faida zinazopatikana ndani yao ambazo haziwezi kupatikana mahali pengine.\n4. Fath al-Bari ya al-Hafidh ibn Hajr, kwani sio ufafanuzi tu wa [ Sahih ] al-Bukhari, bali, ni ufafanuzi wa vitabu vyote vya sihah ( pl. ya sahih ), sunan, na  masanid (pl. ya musnad ); na ndio tegemeo kubwa kwa wafasiri wa hadith baada yake",
  "succinctSub14aPar3": "5. Maandishi yote ya wasomi wanaoongoza wa Da’wah an-Najdiyyah ( رحمه الله), na haswa: Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah , kwani ni kama jina lake linavyopendekeza. \n6. Maandishi yote ya Shaykh ‘Abdur-Rahman al-Mu‘allimi (رحمه الله), Dhahabu wa nyakati zetu, haswa: At-Tankil na Al-Anwar al-Kashifah  .\n7. Vidokezo vilivyoandikwa na Shaykh ‘Abdur-Rahman ibn Qasim juu ya Ar-Rawd al-Murbi’, kwani ni kutoka kwa bora zaidi ya yale yaliyoandikwa katika fiqh, na kuna alama, vito, na faida ndani yake ambazo haziwezi kupatikana mahali pengine.\n8. Maandishi yote ya Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (رحمه الله) , kwani yeye ni miongoni mwa watu wa wakati ulio bora katika uandishi, akielezea maswala anuwai, na bora kati yao kwa faida.\n9. Kuhusiana na kile ambacho watu wa wakati huu wameandika katika sayansi ya hadith, kazi za Shaykh Tariq ibn ‘Awdillah zimetokana na kile kilichoandikwa; vitabu vyake ni vya thamani, na ufafanuzi wake wa Nukhbah al-Fikr ni kutoka kwa ufafanuzi wake bora.",
  "succinctSub14aPar4": "Hii [ndio mbinu] ya mtu kuchukua jukumu la kusaidia kufanikisha azma yake.\n\nSwalah ya Allah iwe juu nabii wetu Muhammad,  nyumba yake, na maswahaba wake kwa jumla.",

Walakini, njia ni ndefu, waalifu wa barabara kuu wameenea, na misiba inayoathiri nia ni nyingi na iliyofichwa. Kwa hivyo inahitajika kwa mwanafunzi wa maarifa kusasisha nia yake kila wakati, kwani ni jambo ambalo hubadilika mara nyingi.",
  "succinctSub2Par1": "Hii inafanikiwa kupitia vitendo vya utii, kuzingatia  istighfar (kutaka msamaha), kufanywa upya kwa  tawbah (toba), na kuepuka kutotii, kwani ni kati ya vizuizi vikuu ukitafuta elimu. The student of knowledge is denied [knowledge] and forgets what he memorizes and understanding becomes difficult, all due to disobedience.",
  "succinctSub3Par1": "Kumuomba Yeye, akimwita Yeye, kuwa mnyenyekevu mbele Yake, breaking down between His hands, seeking guidance and correctness from Him, attaching [oneself] to “ la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah ”  (there is no strength nor power except with Allah) and the multitude of supplications narrated on this subject, like: {succinctDua1} “ Rabbi zidni ‘ilma  ” (My Lord, increase me in knowledge){succinctDua2} \n“Subhanaka la ‘ilma lana illa ma ‘allamtana, innaka anta al- ‘Alim al-Hakim ” (Glorified are You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us.

  "succinctSub4Par1": "Ni juu ya mwanafunzi kutenda kulingana na elimu yake, kwani hii ndiyo lengo la maarifa; sio kwa kujipamba nayo mbele ya watu.

Na ningependa kuelezea maswala mawili hapa:",
  "succinctSub4Par2": "1. Kujishughulisha na kusoma tu vitabu, kuhifadhi  mutun (maandishi mafupi), kukusanya na kufundisha elimu, kunatia ugumu moyoni; na hivyo kufanya ibada kuwa nzito kwa mwanafunzi. Kwa sababu hiyo, anapaswa kuchukua wakati wa vipindi vya kusoma kwa ibada ya hiari. Anapaswa kusoma maisha ya waadilifu, kwa sababu hii hulainisha moyo na inamshawishi mtu kuchukua hatua, kwa idhini ya Allah.",
  "succinctSub4Par3": "2. Hapa pana dhana potofu, ambayo wanafunzi wavivu wa elimu huleta, wale ambao elimu ni rahisi lakini ibada ni nzito. Ni: “kutafuta maarifa ni bora kuliko ibada za hiari.” Dhana hii potofu haipaswi kumdanganya mtu yeyote, kwani mambo haya mawili hayagongani kati yao kwa kanuni ambayo mtu anapaswa kuweka juu ya nyingine. Unapaswa kuangalia wasomi wakubwa wa ummah kutoka kwa Sahabah, Tabi‘in, na wale waliowafuata, na uone walikuwa maarufu kwa ibada yao. Elimu unapewa kipaumbele juu ya ibada ikiwa kuna mgongano kati ya hizo mbili na hakuna njia ya kupatanisha na kuunganisha mambo yote pamoja; na hii haionekani isipokuwa katika hali maalum adimu.",
  "succinctSub5Par1": "Mwanafunzi lazima afanye bidii, awe na bidii, na ajitahidi, haswa mwanzoni mwa kutafuta [maarifa]. Inasemekana: mafanikio unajumuisha akili moja ya kumi na sehemu ya kumi ya bidii. Na yeyote anayelalamika juu ya udhaifu kwa kuweza kuhifadhi au kuelewa, inaweza kurekebisha kwa kuwa na azima madhubuti, kuacha uvivu, na kuongeza juhudi mara mbili. Kwa hivyo kwa matakwa ya mtu yeyote ni madhubuti, nia ni sahihi, na hujitahidi ipasavyo katika mambo yake atafikia lengo, ikiwa Allah anataka.",
  "succinctSub6Par1": "Mwanafunzi [wa maarifa] hapaswi kujishughulisha - haswa mwanzoni - na miundo ya njia, kutoka kwa maswala ya kushangaza na udanganyifu wa maarifa for ambao hauna dhamana yoyote isipokuwa kupita kwa wakati na kushinda washirika. Badala yake, anapaswa kuwa na bidii katika kudhibiti kanuni za sayansi na kuelewa mambo muhimu zaidi.",
  "succinctSub7Par1": "Kwa hivyo mwanafunzi [wa maarifa] anapaswa kutafuta ukweli na uthibitisho wake kutoka kwa Kitabu na Sunnah bila kuwa na ushabiki kwa madhhab, msomi, au shaykh, kwani taarifa ya kila mtu inaweza kukubalika au kuachwa isipokuwa ya Mtume (ﷺ).",
  "succinctSub8Par1": "Kanuni hizo ni za aina mbili:\n1. Msingi wa sayansi zote, na ni: at-tawhid; mwanafunzi [wa maarifa] kamwe hatokuwa na udhuru kwa kutokuijua.\n2.

Kwa hivyo usul wa kila uwanja ni sura zake muhimu, kategoria, istilahi, na maswala yake.",
  "succinctSub9Par1": "Kwa hivyo, ni lazima kwa mwanafunzi kuhifadhi mutun, madalili, maneno [ya wasomi], na mambo ya msingi. Viwango vya kuhifadhi ni vinne: \n1. Kuhifadhi maneno ya mutun; na huu ndio msingi. Mwanafunzi hapaswi kuacha hii isipokuwa inakuwa ngumu kwake.\n2. Kuhifadhi mutun kwa maana zao; kwa hivyo mwanafunzi hukariri matn kwa ukamilifu, iwe kwa maneno yake au kwa maana yake na yasibaki kwa maneno ya mwandishi kwa sababu sio suala la ibada.",

  "tawheedAboutAuthor": "Sheikh-ul-Islam, Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahhab, alikuwa msomi mashuhuri wa dini na mrekebishaji mkubwa wa nyakati zake. Alikuwa na nafasi ya kipekee na isiyo na kifani kama mtangazaji wa Qur'an, Hadith na matawi tofauti ya maarifa. Akiwa na akili na ufahamu wa kina juu ya ujifunzaji wa dini, aliwavutia wasomi wa hali ya juu na kuwaleta karibu na maoni yake mwenyewe. Katika kazi zake, Sheikh-ul-Islam hajaifafanua the Qur'an na Sunnah tu, bali ameng'oa maoni ya washirikina na imefanya mapambano magumu kutokomeza uzushi na nyongeza.\n\n~ Nawaqid al-Islam \n~ Masharti, Nguzo na Mahitaji ya Swala",
  "tawheedA3Par1": "Hii ni kwa sababu wengi walipinda kwa anwani ya ‘Uluw (Allāh kuwa juu ya ‘Arsh). Wakikataa kuwa hii sifa ya Allāh hutukia kwa kukataa sifa nyengine ambayo ni Istiwā’ (Utawala) wa Allāh juu ya kiti (Chake) cha Enzi ‘Arsh in a manner befitting His Majesty and this leads to denial of Āyāt in the Qur’ān as Allāh has clearly stated this, so you can see why it’s so dangerous.",
  "tawheedA3Par2": "Ikiwa watu wengi wakiulizwa Allāh yuko wapi, wanaezasema Allāh yuko binguni, ama Allāh yuko kila mahali (hata pahala pachafu, wal-‘Iyathubillāh) ama Allāh Amekaa kwenye Enzi. Lakini hivyo sivyo na haya ambatani na imani sahihi. Tunaamini Allāh’s knowledge encompasses everything but Allāh isn’t physically present everywhere. Allāh is above His ‘Arsh and He rose over it in a manner that is befitting to His Majesty.",
  "tawheedA3Par3": "Allāh Anayajua yanayowatendekea waja wake hapa duniani na yatakayowatendekea Akhera na sisi hatutowai dhamini chochote katika Elimu yake. Ikiwa tutazungumza kwa sauti, basi kwa yakini Allāh anayajua na anayajua siri na yaliofichika kwetu knows. Allāh Hushuka kwa bingu ya chini zaidi kila usiku kwa namna anayoyajua Yeye. Hatufai kuuliza ni vipi ama kuibadilish maana kwani hivyo ndivyo watu walipinda [kutoka kwa dini].",
  "tawheedA3Par4": " At-Tirmidhī (رحمه الله) anamelezo marefu kuhusu jambo hili. Kutaja kwa muhtasar, alisema:\n“Ishakushasemwa na zaidi ya wanazuoni kutoka kwa wanachuoni kuhusu hii mapokezi na yaliyosemwa kama hayo kuhusu sifa ya Allāh — na kuwa Mola wetu hushuka kwa mbingu ya chini kila usiku. Kwa hivyo wanachuoni walisema: ‘Dhibitisha haya mapokezi, kuwa na imani kwazo, usifanye taswira akilini, wa kuuliza ni vipi.’” [As-Sunan ya At-Tirmidhī (Numberi. 662)]",
  "tawheedA3Par5": "Kwa hivyo, Allāh Yuko juu ya viumbe Vyake, juu ya ulimwengu, juu ya mbingu, juu ya ‘Arsh [Kiti cha Enzi] Yake. Anauwezo wote juu ya watu wote na viumbe Vyake na Yuko juu ya kula mtu na kila tiku kwenye Uwezo. Hii ndio ‘Aqīdah ya watu wa Kweli, Ahl Sunnah wal Jamā’ah. NA Allāh Anajua zaidi.",

  "tawheedA4Par2": "*NA KUFR YAO NI KUFR AKBAR* (kufr kubwa) by Ijmaa (concensus) and this consensus was reported by Ibn Kathir and others from his contemporaries from Ahlus Sunnah. Allaah Said: And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the Kafirun. [Al-Maaidah 5:44] And Allah Says: “Have you seen those (hyprocrites) who claim that they believe  in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before  you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the Taghut (false judges, n.k.) while they have been ordered to reject them.” [An Nisaa' 4:60]",
  "tawheedA4Par3": "And Allah Says: Or have they partners with Allah (false gods), who have instituted  for them a religion which Allah has not allowed. [Ash-Shoora 42:21] And this is the case today, we see them judge between the people by the man  made laws and in some places that is called by other than its name, however we look at the reality and the meaning (of these laws) and not the name  and deceits (given to them). As for the Judge, if he judges in a single case by his whims or desires, and not  according to the man made laws, regulations, the system or by customs or traditions, then this here is Kufr Duna Kufr, as in the hadeeth:",
  "tawheedA4Par4": "The judges are three: Two judges that are in the Fire” Then it speaks about the ignorant judge and the judge who rules by desires – and this is the relevant point from the hadeeth. (reported in the Sunan) And Ibn Abdil Barr said in “Al Tamheed” that this example is from the major sins by ijma – and this was what happened in that Umawiyyah and Abbasiyyah states. ",
  "tawheedA5Par1": "Do not go to the courts of the Taaghut which rule by man made laws, and adopt the Millah of Ibrahim, that is: when they said to their people: “Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allah, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred for ever, until you believe in Allah Alone,” [Al-Mumtahinah 60:4]",
  "tawheedA5Par2": "And act upon these ayat, Allah said: Therefore proclaim openly that which you are commanded, and turn away from Al-Mushrikun [Al-Hijr 15:94] And Allaah Says: Follow what has been inspired to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) from your Lord, La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He) and turn aside from Al-Mushrikun. [Al An'aam 6:106] And Allah Said: Say: O you kafiroon, I worship not that what you worship. [Al-Kaafiroon 109:2]",

  "tawheedA6Par1": "Know that the narration of ibn abbaas (رضي الله عنه) saying Kufr Duna Kufr (Kufr of a lesser degree) is a weak and it’s Muttarib narration means Unstable and not authentic as researched by great Scholar of Hadiths Shaikh Sulaymaan ibn Naasir Al-Ulwaan(حفظه الله) he said: \"As for the statement of those who said it is [Sūrah Ma'idah 44] KUFR DUNA KUFR (Lesser Disbelieve) in reference to the Hadith  of Abbas, Imām Hākim said; it related by Hishām  bn Hujayr from Tawus from Ibn Abbas who said it is KUFR DUNA KUFR (KUFR of a lesser Disbelieve) and this Hadith is weak of two defect:",
  "tawheedA6Par2": "The first defect: is the weakness of Hishām bn Hujayr (as a narrator).\nThe second deffect: the Hadith is in contrary to a Hadith that is agreed upon by the consensus, it has been related by Abdullah bn Fawas, from his father, from Ibn Abbas who said: it is (Ruling by other than what Allah has revealed) is KUFR [Major Disbelieve].

Some of them said, ibn abbaas said it and some said Taawus said it (a Taaba’ee who never met prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم .(Kwanza, this difference should be cleared because this is not clear who made this statement.",
  "tawheedA6Par4": "Wacha tuseme kwa ajili ya mjadala kwamba Ibn Abbaas alisema Kufr Duna Kufr. Alikuwa akizungumzia nini ? Alikuwa akizumgumza na nani ? Ibn Abbaas alikuwa akizumgumza na Khawarij ambaye aliishi wakati wa Ali (رضي الله عنه). Ibn abbaas hakuwa anazungumza juu ya Shari’ah. Je! unajua nikwanini? Kwa sababu hakuvunja Shari’ah wakati wa ukhalifa wake na alikuwa mmoja wa Makhalifa wanne walioongozwa sawa. Kwa hivyo Shari’ah haikupewa shaka. Kwa hiyo, Shari’ah haikuwa mada ambayo ilikuwa ikijadiliwa. Ibn Abbaas alikuwa anazungumza juu ya Fitnah ya Ali na Muaaviyah (رضي الله عنهما). Sahaabah kumuua Sahaabah.",
  "tawheedA6Par5": "The Madkhali waliweka spin kwenye Hadithi na wakasema: “Alichomaanisha Ibn Abbaas meant ni Sharee'ah ya Allah. Unapoivunja Shari’ah ya Allah ni Kufr Duna Kufr (kufr ndogo). Kwa hivyo unavunja Shari’ah usijali juu yake, kwa sababu ni kufr ndogo”. Kutoka hapa Madkhali amemsingizia Allah kwa msimamo mkali wakati Allah Aliwaadhibu watu wa Sabato kwa kuvunja sheria ya Allah wakati huo kwa kuwageuza nyani na nguruwe! Ingawa ilikuwa tu (Kufr ndogo)",
  "tawheedA6Par6": "This is the spin they (Madkhali) put on it. We say to them. Ibn Katheer and ibn Taymiyyah said: Ibn Katheer said: “So whosoever abandons the wise Shari’ah which was revealed to Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) the seal of prophets and goes to other abrogated Shari’ah for judgement, he becomes a kaafir. So how about the one who goes to al-yaasiq (man-made law) for judgment and gives it precedence over the Shari’ah of Muhammad. Whosoever does this has become a kaafir by the ijmaa (consensus) of the muslims. [Al-Bidaaya Wan-Nihaaya, Vol-13, Pg : 119] ",
  "tawheedA6Par7": "Examine carefully the Fatwa of Ibn Katheer. He said: “The mere abandonment of the Shari’ah makes him a Kaafir.”A Madkhali, Saudi salafi will say: “You have to abandon the Shari’ah plus have to give legitimacy to the abandonment. You have to do istihlaal (to make what is Halaal and Haraam) So as long as you didn’t legitimise its abandonment and didn’t do istihlaal you’re fine and good to go and you’re a Muslim perfect in Eemaan.”This is how evil this people are. The hadith Kufr Duna Kufr is a weak hadith and you can’t base your Aqeedah on weak hadith.",
  "tawheedA6Par8": "Ibn taymiyyah said: And it is known from the religion of islaam by necessity and by the consensus of all muslims that whoever legalizes to follow other than the Shari’ah of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم),he is a Kaafir. And his Kufr is similar to that of the one who believes in some part of the book (qur-aan) and reject some of it.” [Majmu’ Al-Fataawa, Vol-28, Pg : 524]",
  "tawheedA6Par9": "If to dismantle the Shari’ah of allaah was a minor issue, why did allaah change the jews to apes and swine in the time of David when they dislodged the Shari’ah ? [Al-Maaidah:60] May be Madkhalis are saying, Allaah was overreacting. May be that’s what they’re claiming that He (Allaah) was overreacting because he turned the jews into apes and swine for something which was minor (Na’oozubillaah).

  "tawheedQ1": "Je! ni maoni gani sahihi kuhusu uamuzi wa Sāhir[mchawi]?",
  "tawheedQ1Par1": "Shaykh(حفظه الله) alijibu kwa kusema: Al-Sihr[Uchawi] kwa kila namna ni Harām kwa kila Sharī'ah, na imekubalika kwayo kuhusu makatazo yake na makatazo ya kujielimisha sihir. Na sihir ama kuifanya sihir huenda kinyume na yale aliyo kuja nayo Mtume Muhammad (ﷺ), na pia huenda kinyume na makusudio ya kushukishwa kitabu[Qur'an] cha Allâh",
  "tawheedQ1Par2": "Na wengi katika maulamaa walichukua mtazamo kuwa Sāhir[Mchawi] ni Kāfir, na ni wajibu juu ya kiongozi wa kiisilamu kumuuwa. Allâh(سبحانه وتعالى) Amesema \"Na Sulaymān hakukufuru, bali mashetani ndio waliokufuru, wakiwafundisha watu Sihr(uchawi)\" na Allâh(سبحانه وتعالى) akasema tena \"Wala [Malaika hao] hawakumfundisha yeyote mpaka wamwambie, \"Hakika sisi ni mtihani(wa kutazamwa kutii kwenu); basi usikufuru\", Yaani [usikufuru] kwa kufanya Sihr, kwa hayo imebainika kuwa hii ni Kufr[UKAFIRI].",
  "tawheedQ1Par3": "Na wengi katika Fuqahā' kutoka kwa Shāfi'iyyâh waliichukulia mtazamo kuwa Sāhir hawi kafiri, mpaka aitikadi usawa wa Sihr au aitikadi kama watu wa Bābil walivyo amini, kutoka kuwa karibu na nyota saba.\nNa hii haijaafikiwa, na hakuna dalili kwa hoja kuwa \"Kuamini\" [kwa Sihr kuwa Kafiri].",
  "tawheedQ1Par4": "Na kilicho sahihi ni kuwa Sāhir ni Kāfiri, ikiwa anaamini ni Harām au la, kwa hivyo kufanya Sihr ni Kufr, na hii ndio iliyo wazi kutoka kwa ushahidi, na hakuna chochote katika maandiko mengine yanayopinga hii. \nNa akiitwa ama akinasibishwa mtu na Sihr kupitia kwa dalili, basi afaa kuuliwa, kwani hiyo imethibitishwa kutoka kwa kundi la Masahābah, hata hivyo hairuhusiwi kwa mtu yeyote kati ya watu kutumia adhabu bila Amri ya Sultān[Mkuu / Kiongozi] au yeyote anayeshikilia nafasi yake, kwa sababu kutumia adhabu bila amri ya wale walio na mamlaka kutasababisha ufisadi, na utulivu kwa usalama[wa nchi], na makusudio ya Sultān itatoweka.[Kimsingi inakuwa machafuko, kila mtu akiichukua mikononi mwake]",
  "tawheedQ2": "Ni tofauti gani kati ya ittibā' na Taqlīd?",
  "tawheedQ2Par1": "Ittibā' ni kufuata imamu [kiongozi] kulingana na ushahidi ambao yeye hutoa kutoka kwa Sharī'ah; hii inaitwa ittibā' - sio taqlīd. Sio lawama kujitaja mwenyewe kama mfuasi wa Imām/mwanachuoni fulani - ikiwa hii ni kwa sababu ya ushahidi. Ushahidi wa hiyo kusema kwamba mimi namfuata Imām fulani-na-fulani kudhamiria kwa dalili kutoka kwa Sharī‘, ni ḥadīth ya Al-Irbādh ibn Ṣāriyah; kuwa Mtume wa Allāh ﷺ amesema: \"Shikamana na Sunnah zangu na Sunnah za Makhalifa waongofu sahihi. Kujikita kwayo thabiti kwa magego.\"",

  "tawheedQ2Par3": "Kwa hivyo Yeye (Aliyetakasika) aliita hiyo ittibā‘; ingawa kile kinachokusudiwa ni kuzingatia dalili za Sharī‘. Vivyo hivyo, Akasema tena Allāh: \n{tawheedAya2}\n“Na atakayemwasi Mtume baada ya kumdhihirikia uongofu na akafuata njia (yattabi‘) isiyokuwa ya Waislamu,” [Sūrah An-Nisā' 115]",
  "tawheedQ2Par4": "Kuonyesha kwamba kufuata njia ya waumini kunaweza kutajwa kama ittibā'. Vivyo hivyo, imekuja kutoka kwa ḥadīthi (kwamba Mtume ﷺ alisema): “Ikiwa watamtii Abū Bakr na ‘Umar, watakuwa wameongoka,” na katika ḥadīth nyengine: “Fuata hawa wawili baada yangu; Yaani Abū Bakr na ‘Umar;” ḥadīthi ya kwanza imenakiliwa na Muslim na kurejelewa na Abū Qatādah, na ya pili imenakiliwa na Aḥmad na kurejelewa na Ḥudhayfah(رضي الله عنه).\nNa vile vile, (ushahidi mwingine ni) Jumla wa maana unaopatikana ndani ya maneno ya Allāh:\n{tawheedAya3}\n“Wafuateni hawa wanaokufundisheni bila ya kutaka ujira; na hali ya kuwa wenyewe wameongoka.” [Sūrah Yā-Sīn 21]",
  "tawheedQ2Par5": "Na hii Āyah hupita kiasi cha Mitume. Ama Taqlīd (kufuata kipofupofu); ni kufuata mtu ambaye yeye binafsi si ḥujjah (dalili) na pia bila ḥujjah (dalili).

  "usuryPar2": "1. That Zinā is greater in Harām than Ribā in both its types: Debt and Remnants.\n2. That committing adultery with Mahrams is from the biggest of Harām, and from the greatest of sins, and a group among the Scholars have gone to say that whoever commits adultery with a Mahram of his is to be struck with the sword, even if he was not Married, and that is because of the severe matter of Zinā, but the Majority of the Scholars went to say that he's lashed like others, and it's completely fine to whip him[Ta'zīr].\nAnd thereupon, how can you make the Ribā dealings, and the lowest level of Ribā greater in prohibition in the sight of Allâh(سبحانه وتعالى)than a man who commits adultery with a Mahram of his?!! Rather, he committed adultery with his Mother, wal-'Iyāthû Billâh?!!.",
  "usuryPar3": "3. That the Prophet(ﷺ) said in the Hadīth \"The most prevalent kind of Ribā is going to lengths in talking unjustly against a Muslim's honour.\" So the outward meaning of this Narration is that the most severe Ribā in the sight of Allâh(سبحانه وتعالى)is going into length in talking unjustly against a Muslim's honour, and what kind of elongation is more severe than having a slave[of Allâh] commit Zinā with his Mother, this is the greatest type of elongation[going to lengths in talking unjustly against a Muslim's honour]",
  "usuryPar4": "So it's understood that the last Hadīth contradicts the first [Hadīth], because if he said \"And the lowest is a man committing adultery with his Mother, & The most prevalent kind of Ribā is going to lengths in talking unjustly against a Muslim's honour.\", it is as if this report doesn't consider committing adultery from going into lengths in talking unjustly against a Muslim's honour, and sufficient is the gruesomeness and atrociousness of that.",
  "usuryPar5": "And this matter is picked up by the intellect, and is understood by the text, and no one can stubbornly contend with it, and that's why Imām Abū Hātim(رحمه الله), Ibn al-Jawzī( الله رحمه ) and a group of Scholars have judged upon this report as being Fabricated and a Lie, and the statements of whoever authenticated it isn't taken into account at all.",
  "usuryPar6": "And this reaffirms the meaning which we stress on always returning back to the words of the Imāms of the Salaf, and not being confined to authenticating reports based upon the outwardness of the chains, or simply relying upon the statements of the Later Scholars.",
