# An Introduction To Tawheed and Sunnah

# The Salaf of the Ummah

**In the Name of Allāh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful**
<!-- --- -->
**And may the peace and abundant blessings of Allāh be upon Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Judgment And thereafter:**

## The correct intention
The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Verily the deeds are (judged) according to their intentions, and verily for every person
there is (the reward of) what he has intended. So whoever performed hijrah to Allāh and
His Messenger, then his hijrah is for Allāh and His Messenger. And whoever performed
hijrah to some dunyā in order to achieve it, or for a woman in order to marry her, then his
hijrah is for that which he performed hijrah for."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī and Sahīh Muslim)

Verily, the intention of a person can change his deeds from being something that benefits him, to being something which leads him into destruction. Just as the Prophet (ﷺ) informed about this in a *hadīth* about the events on the Day of Judgment:

***"And a man, who learned the knowledge, taught it (to others) and recited the Qurān. Then he will be brought forth and He makes him aware of His blessings, and he acknowledges them. He will say: ‘What did you do with it?’ He will say: ‘I learned the knowledge and
taught it, and for You I recited the Qurān.’ He will say: ‘You have lied. Rather, you learned the knowledge so it would be said: He is a scholar. And you recited the Qurān so it would be said: He is a reciter. And it has verily been said.’ Then orders are given
regarding him, and he is dragged on his face until he is thrown in Hellfire."*** (Sahīh Muslim)

So the reader is advised to invoke the Name of Allāh and to correct his intention before beginning to read this book, and before every deed he performs. The successful is the one
who changes his intention to be solely for Allāh. So whatever he does is only to achieve the Satisfaction of Allāh and to protect himself from the Wrath of Allāh. As for the one
who seeks knowledge only to discuss, only to find mistakes or to elevate himself to a higher level by lowering others and pointing out their mistakes, then his intention will surely render his deeds void, and there will be no benefit in them.

## Introduction
These are simple words describing the fundamentals upon which the religion of Islām is built. Allāh – the Exalted – has chosen Islām as the religion for His slaves, and He does not
accept anything but it. So whoever wants to meet Allāh in a state which will guarantee him entrance into Paradise, then he must base his religion in this life upon that which has
been revealed by Allāh to His Messenger (ﷺ), and he must not die except upon this.

The Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) is Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullāh Al-Qurashī (ﷺ) who was born in Makkah. He received the revelation from Allāh – the Exalted – through the angel Jibrīl (عليه السلام) at the age of forty. Ten
years after the first revelation the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was taken on a night journey in which the five daily prayers was revealed to him. After this he (ﷺ) remained in
Makkah for another three years after which he emigrated to Madīnah. Here he continued to invite towards his Lord until Allāh – the
Exalted – took his soul at the age of sixty-three, where he (ﷺ) had fulfilled his mission. He was buried in Madīnah where his grave is still present. May the peace and abundant blessings of Allāh be upon the final Prophet and Messenger from Allāh. Āmīn.

Allāh – the Exalted – has made the religion which He is pleased with very easy, and He –the Exalted – does not want any difficulty for mankind. Allāh – the Exalted – says:

**“He chose you, and He did not make any difficulty for you in the religion;** (which is) **the *millah* of Ibrāhīm your father.”**(Al-Hajj 22:78)

So let not anyone think for a second, that Allāh has made the correct path difficult to spot among the different types of misguidances, or that Allāh has allowed that a person follows a way or a path, and then "hopes" that this is the right path which Allāh is pleased with.
Rather Allāh revealed the Book with clarification and He sent a Messenger to be a bearer of glad tidings for those who follow the revelation and a warner for those who deviate
from it. He did this in order for a person to be upon *yaqīn* (full certainty) in his religion and so his heart may feel the tranquility of being upon the truth and long for the meeting
with its Lord. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”There is no compulsion in the religion. Verily have the Straight Path become clear from the wrong path.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:256)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”Messengers as bearer of glad tidings and warners. In order that mankind will have no argument against Allāh after the messengers. And Allāh is ever Almighty and All-Wise.”** (An-Nisā 4:165)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”He arranges the affairs** (and) **explains the *āyāt*** (evidences, verses, signs) **in details, in order for you to have full certainty in the meeting with your Lord.”** (Ar-Ra’d 13:2)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Verily the believers are those who believe in Allāh, and thereafter do not doubt.”** (Al-Hujurāt 49:15)

And the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) said:

***"I have verily left you upon a clear path. Its night is like its day. No-one deviates from it after me, except that he will be destroyed."*** (Sunan Ibn Mājah – *sahīh*)

And that which the Messenger (ﷺ) has left for us, is the Qurān the
Word of Allāh, which was sent by Allāh through Jibrīl (عليه السلام) to Muhammad (ﷺ), and the *Sunnah* which is everything which the Prophet (ﷺ) has said, done, showed to us and confirmed

So the intended with this text is to clarify the fundamental principles based upon which this religion is built in an easy, simple and categorized way, so the Muslim may know how to seek his religion, from whom and from where he should accept and from whom and
from where he should reject, and for him to have a template with which he can verify whether or not that which he believes in is correct and thereby achieve full certainty in his religion. As for each individual issue mentioned, then this text only suffices as a short introduction.

All success is from Allāh, while all mistakes are from the author.

## The sources of the religion

Al-Islām is built upon two primary sources [ Among the legislative sources of Islām are also the ijmā’ (agreement of the Muslims) and the *qiyās* (analogy based on other evidences from the Qurān and *Sunnah*). The statements and the beliefs of the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) are furthermore considered to be a part of the *Sunnah* itself, since it is not claimed that they would speak about the religion from themselves, rather they would only speak based on what they knew from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ). ] ,
and that is the Qurān and the *Sunnah*. Everything which does not have its foundation in any of these two, then it is misguidance and rejected for the one who believes in it.

**But can anyone understand the Qurān and the *Sunnah* as he wishes or desires? The answer is no.**

Allāh – the Exalted – chose to reveal His religion upon a people who – by the permission of Allāh – were capable of comprehending it, following it and protecting it. Allāh – the
Exalted – testified to the righteousness of those generations several places in His Book. From this testimony are His – the Exalted – words:

**“And whoever contradicts** (or opposes) **the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers' way. We shall keep him on
the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination.”** (An-Nisā 4:115)

And His – the Exalted – words:

**“And the first forerunners** (in *īmān*) **among the *Muhājirīn* and the *Ansār* and those who followed them in goodness. Allāh is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him,
and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment.”** (At-Tawbah 9:100)

And the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) said:

***"The best people are those of my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī and Sahīh Muslim)

The generation of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) is the ***Sahābah*** (رضي الله عنهم) who lived with and saw the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ). They understood the Qurān and the *Sunnah* best, because they lived during its
revelation, they experienced the scenarios which it spoke of and they are those who were closest to the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), asking him questions, hearing his speech and seeing his deeds.

The generation after them is the ***tābi’ūn*** (the followers) who are those who learned from the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم). Thus their status in the religion is based upon them learning from the *Sahābah* who learned from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ).

The generations after them is the ***tābi’ at-tābi’īn*** (the followers of the followers) who are
those who learned from the followers of the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم). Thus their status in the religion is based upon them learning from the tābi’ūn, who learned from the *Sahābah* who learned from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ).

These are the three generations whom the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) has described as the best of generations from this Ummah, and they are our ***Salaf*** (predecessors). So whoever wants to follow that which Allāh is pleased with and love, he
must follow these three generations in their religion, whose sources are directly from the Qurān and *Sunnah*. Because there will never be any people after them who are better.

Anas Ibn Mālik (رضي الله عنه) said:

*"Have patience. Because verily there will not come a time upon you, except that (the time) after it is worse than it. Until you meet you Lord. I heard that from your Prophet (ﷺ)."* (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

And ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas’ūd (رضي الله عنه) said:

*"There is no year except that the year after it is worse than it. I am not speaking about one year which has more rain than another, nor a year which is more fertile than another, nor a leader which
is better than another leader. Rather (I am speaking about) the disappearance of the best people among you and your scholars, and then a people will emerge who measure the affairs according to
their own opinion (and not the Qurān and Sunnah), and then Islām will be destroyed and broken."* (Al-Bida’ by Ibn Al-Waddāh)

So the people of truth are those who say:

***"We follow and believe in the Qurān and the Sunnah, according to the understanding of the Salaf."***

And this is not merely a statement with them. Rather there is not a verse in the Book of Allāh, or a *hadīth* from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), or any belief which is held in the religion, except that they investigate and ask:

Is this how the *Salaf* have understood and acted upon this verse?

Is this how the *Salaf* have understood and acted upon this *hadīth*?

Is this how the *Salaf* have believed in this issue?

With this they uphold the boundaries of Islām by not letting any form of misguidance nor innovation enter upon them in their religion. And with this they are truthful in their claim
of following the Qurān and *Sunnah* in accordance with the understanding of the *Salaf*. And with this they can profess to be followers of and believers in Tawhīd and *Sunnah* in reality,
and not just as an empty claim with no substance to it.

Abū Bakr Al-Ājurrī (d. 320h) gathered the meaning of what have been mentioned in this section when he mentioned:

*"And Ibn ‘Abdul-Hamīd also narrated to us and said: Zuhayr ibn Muhammad narrated to us and said: Sulaymān ibn Harb narrated to us and said: Hammād ibn Zayd narrated to us, from ‘Āsim
Al-Ahwal who said: Abū Al-‘Āliyah said: ‘Learn Al-Islām, and then when you have learned it then don’t turn away from it. And it is upon you to follow the Straight Path, and verily is it Al-Islām.
And do not deviate from it right or left. And it is upon you to follow the Sunnah of your Prophet (ﷺ) and that which his Companions are upon. Because verily did we read
the Qurān fifteen years before they did what they did. And be aware of these desires (i.e. innovations) which cause enmity and hatred among the people.’ He said: ‘So I narrated it (i.e. these
words) to Al-Hasan, so he said: ‘He has spoken the truth and given a good advice.’ And I narrated it to Hafsah bint Sīrīn, so she said: ‘O my son, have you narrated this to Muhammad (ibn Sīrīn)?’
So I said: ‘No.’ So she said: ‘Then narrate it to him.’’ And Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan said: ‘The sign of the one whom Allāh wants good for is: Traversing this Path: The Book of Allāh, the Sunan
of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), the Sunan (i.e. narrations) from his Companions (رضي الله عنم) and those who followed them in goodness, and that which the
aimmah (leaders) of the Muslims in all countries were upon, until the end of what there was of scholars. Such as Al-Awzā’ī, Sufyān Ath-Thawrī, Mālik ibn Anas, Ash-Shāfi’ī, Ahmad ibn Hanbal,
Al-Qāsim ibn Salām, and whoever were upon the same path as them. And avoiding every madhhab (way, path, opinion) which these scholars have criticized."* (Ash-Sharī’ah by Al-Ājurrī 1/301)

And Abū ‘Amr Al-Awzā’ī (d. 157h) said:

*"And I advise you to one thing, which verily will remove the doubt from you, and by holding on to it you will achieve the Straight Path, if Allāh – the Exalted – wills: You look into what the
Companions of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) were upon in this issue. Then if they differed in it, then take whatever agrees with you from their sayings. In that case you will be
at ease in the issue. And if they agreed in the issue upon one opinion, and no-one among them deviated from it, then to where is the madhhab that opposes them? Because verily the destruction
lies is disagreeing with them. Because they have verily never agreed upon one issue, and then the guidance (i.e. truth) has been in something else than it. And verily did Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla –
praise those who followed their example, when He said:* **"And those who followed them in goodness."** (At-Tawbah 9:100). *And be aware of everyone who interprets the Qurān to
something else than what they were upon."* (Al-Ibānah Al-Kubrā by Ibn Battah 2/254)

And Al-Awzā’ī (d. 157h) also said:

*"It is obligatory upon you (to follow) the āthār (narrations) of those who came before, even if the people would reject you. And be aware of the opinions of men, even if they beautify their words for you."* (Ash-Sharī’ah by Al-Ājurrī)

And Abū Sa’īd Ad-Dārimī (d. 280h) said:

*"Allāh – the Exalted – praised the tābi’ūn in His Book, when He said: **"And the first forerunners (in īmān) among the Muhājirīn and the Ansār and those who followed them in
goodness. Allāh is pleased with them."** So He testified to their following of the Sahābah, and them deserving the Pleasure of Allāh – the Exalted – due to their following of the Companions of
Muhammad (ﷺ). And the word is united among all the Muslims that they were called ‘At-Tābi’ūn’ and they continue to narrate from them with the chains of narration,
just as they narrated from the Sahābah. And they use them as an argument in the affairs of their religion, and they consider their opinion more binding than the opinion of those who came after
them, due to the name which they deserved from Allāh – the Exalted – and from the Jamā’ah of the Muslims, who called them the followers of the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ)."* (An-Naqd by Ad-Dārimī)

And Abū Al-Qāsim Al-Lālakāī (d. 418h) said:

*"I use as evidence for the madhāhib (pl. madhhab) of Ahlus-Sunnah that which is mentioned in the Book of Allāh – the Exalted – regarding it, and that which is narrated from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) . So if I find something in both of them, then I mention it all. And if I find something in only one of them without the other, then I mention that. And if I don’t find
anything regarding it except from the Sahābah (رضي الله عنهم); those whom Allāh and His Messenger has ordered to take as an example, and to follow their words, and to seek light from their
lights, due to them testifying the revelation and their knowledge regarding the meaning of the interpretations, then I use that as evidence. But if there is no narration regarding it from a
companion, then from those who followed them in goodness; those in whose words there is a cure and guidance. And worshipping Allāh with their opinion is nearness to Allāh and closeness (to
Him). So if we see that they agreed upon something then we rely on it. And whoever’s opinion they criticized, or they refuted his bid’ah (innovation) or they declared takfīr upon him, then we will
judge with that and believe in it. And there continue to be, from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) until this day of ours, a people who protect this way and take it as their religion.
And verily is the person destroyed who turns away from this path, due to his ignorance regarding the path of following (the narrations)."* (Usūl I’tiqād Ahlus-Sunnah by Al-Lālakāī 1/27)

So these are the words from Allāh the Exalted, His Messenger (ﷺ), the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) and the scholars of Islām which all points to, that the
religion is what has come in the Qurān and the *Sunnah*, according to the understanding of the *Salaf*. And that is a path of submitting to and following the evidences and narrations.

May Allāh make us from them. *Āmīn*.

## The testimonies of Islām (At-Tawhīd and *Ar-Risālah*)

The Muslim enters into the religion with the two testimonies. If he meets Allāh based upon their true meanings and having fulfilled their requirements, then Allāh has
promised to enter him into Paradise. These two testimonies are: ***Lā ilāha illa Allāh*** (there is no-one worthy of worship besides Allāh), ***Muhammadun RasulAllāh*** (Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh).

*Lā ilāha illa Allāh* being the Tawhīd (Oneness) of Allāh which every prophet and messenger – from Nūh (عليه السلام) to Muhammad (ﷺ) – has been sent
inviting towards, while *Muhammadun RasūlAllāh* is the *Risālah* (Message) which is the legislation and knowledge which is specific to Muhammad (ﷺ).

There is nothing that the Muslim does in his religion except that it has a relation to these two testimonies. And this is due to the fact that every act of worship – both in deeds and
beliefs – **has two conditions for it to accepted by Allāh**:

1. That it is performed with ***ikhlās*** which is sincerity in intention, meaning that it is solely performed for Allāh without including any form of major or minor *shirk*, which is associating partners with Allāh in worship or in intention.
2. That it is performed according to the ***Sunnah*** of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), meaning that it is performed without any form of innovation.

Thus, whoever bears witness to **Lā ilāha illa Allāh, Muhammadun RasūlAllāh**, has born witness to the fact, that he only worships one *ilāh* (deity, god) – both in beliefs and in
deeds – and that he only worships Allāh the same way that His Messenger *(ﷺ)* has shown us, both in beliefs and in deeds. Therefore a person cannot be a Muslim who is free from *shirk* (i.e. associating partners with Allāh in worship) and *bida’*
(innovation), without knowing the true meaning of these two testimonies, believing in their meanings, acting upon them and avoiding whatever negates them.

And one of these testimonies do not benefit without the other. Whoever worships Allāh alone, but does not believe in the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) nor
follow his path, then he is not a Muslim. And whoever believes in the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) but does not worship Allāh alone – by associating partners
with Him in worship – then he is not a Muslim. Furthermore the two testimonies are undeniably related to each other, which mean that nullifying one of them automatically means nullifying the other, which will become evident in this book.

## The first testimony: *Lā ilāha illa Allāh*

Every type of worship in Islām has its pillars and its conditions which must be fulfilled in order for it to be accepted. For the prayer to be accepted its conditions must be fulfilled
such as being sane, being of age, being in a state of ritual purity, having covered the *‘awrah* etc. And when the conditions are fulfilled it will be accepted from the slave when he
performs the pillars of the prayer, such as the first *takbīrah* (the saying of *‘Allāhu akbar’* at the beginning of the prayer), the Fātihah (the first *sūrah* of the Qurān, which must be recited in each unit of the prayer), the *rukū’* (the bowing), the *sujūd* (the prostration) etc.

Likewise it is with the biggest and most noble of worships; the testimony of ***Lā ilāha illa Allāh.*** The conditions for *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* are seven:

1. ***Ikhlās;*** that it is said sincerely for Allāh alone. This negates ***shirk*** (associating partners with Allāh in worship) and ***riyā*** (showing off or performing deeds to achieve praise).
2. ***Sidq;*** that it is said truthfully while meaning it. This negates ***nifāq*** (showing or saying something outwardly while hiding the opposite inside).
3. ***Qabūl;*** that a person accepts the meaning of it and what it requires of deeds and beliefs. This negates **rejection.**
4. ***‘Ilm;*** that it is said while having knowledge about what it means, necessitates and what negates it. This negates **ignorance.**
5. ***Inqiyād;*** that it is said while submitting to and acting upon its meaning and requirements. This negates **leaving.**
6. ***Mahabbah;*** that a person loves its meaning. This negates **hatred.**
7. ***Yaqīn;*** that it is said with certain faith in its meaning. This negates **doubt.**

It was said to Wahb ibn Munabbih (d. 114h):

*"Is Lā ilāha illa Allāh not the key to Paradise? So he (i.e. Wahb) said: ‘Yes certainly. But there is no key except that it has teeth. So if you come with the key and it has teeth then (the door) will be opened for you. And if not, then it will not be opened for you."* (Al-Bukhārī)

When these conditions are fulfilled by the slave then his performance of and belief in the pillars of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* will be accepted. But as for the one who says *Lā ilāha illa Allāh,*
but he does not do this sincerely for Allāh, rather he does it for other reasons, or he says it while not meaning it, or he does not accept or submit to its meaning, or he is ignorant  
about what it means and necessitates, or he hates it or doubts whether it is the truth or not, then the testimony of this person will not benefit him on the Day of Judgment, even
though he was considered a Muslim in *dunyā* and treated accordingly due to not openly showing any nullifiers of Islām or that he negated any of these conditions.

As for the pillars of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh*, then the testimony of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* is made up by two pillars:

The first is: ***Lā ilāha.*** Translated this means: ‘There is no *ilāh* (worshipped)’, and what is intended is: ‘There is no-one who with right is worshipped’. And this is the part of the
testimony which negates divinity (or worthiness of worship) for everything. And it is also called *al-kufr bit-tāghūt*, which means the rejection of *tāghūt* (something which is worshipped besides Allāh).

The second is: ***Illa Allāh.*** Translated this means: ‘Besides Allāh.’ And this is the part of the testimony which affirms the divinity (or worthiness of worship) for Allāh alone. And it is also called *al-imānu billāh* (the belief in Allāh)

And among the evidences for these two pillars are the words of Allāh the Exalted:

**“Whoever disbelieves in** [or rejects] ***tāghūt*** **and believes in Allāh, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allāh is All-Hearer, All-Knower.”** [Al-Baqarah 2:256]

And His – the Exalted – words:

**“And verily, We have sent among every *Ummah*** (nation) **a Messenger** (proclaiming): **‘Worship Allāh** (Alone), **and avoid** (or keep away from) ***tāghūt*** (everything worshipped besides Allāh).’” (An-Nahl 16:36)

And His – the Exalted – words:

**“And those who avoid *tāghūt* by not worshipping it, and turn in repentance to Allāh, for them are the glad tidings. So give the glad tidings to My slaves.”** (Az-Zumar 39:17)

What easily can be understood from these verses – and that which is already known by mankind through the *fitrah* (natural disposition) – is that Allāh demands from His creation that they worship Him alone, and do not associate any partners with Him the Exalted.

Mu’ādh ibn Jabal (رضي الله عنه) said:

***"I said: ‘O Messenger of Allāh, tell me of an act which will take me into Paradise and will keep me away from Hell fire.’ He said: ‘You have asked me about a major matter, yet it is
easy for him for whom Allāh Almighty makes it easy. You should worship Allāh, and not associate anything with Him (in worship), you should perform the prayers, you should
pay the zakāt, you should fast in Ramadān, and you should make the pilgrimage to the House.’"*** (Sunan At-Tirmidhī – *sahīh*)

And ’Abdullāh ibn ‘Amr (رضي الله عنه) narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Whoever meets Allāh without having associated partners with Him (in worship), then with that (being fulfilled) no mistake (or sin) will harm him. And whoever dies while he
has associating something with Him (in worship), then no good deed will benefit along with that."*** (Narrated by Imām Ahmad – Its *isnād* is correct according to the conditions of Al-Bukhārī and Muslim)

And Ibn Jarīr At-Tabarī (d. 310h) said in his *tafsīr* of the following verse:

**“And your *ilāh* is One *Ilāh*. *Lā ilāha illa Huwa* (there is no-one worthy of worship besides Him). The Most Merciful, the Most Beneficent.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:163)

*"Regarding His words: There is no-one worthy of worship besides Him, then this is an information from Him – uplifted is His mention – that there is no Lord of the Worlds besides Him. Nor does
anything besides Him deserve the worship of the slaves. And that everything which exists besides Him, then He has created it. And that which is obligatory for all of them is obeying Him and
submitting to His order, and leaving the worship of what is beside Him of rivals and false gods, and leaving the idols and statues. This is because He has created all of this. And (obligatory) upon all of
them is dedicating the religion for Him through the wahdāniyyah (oneness) and the ulūhiyyah (worship), and the worship is not suitable for anyone but Him."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

The Qurān, the Sunnah, the words of the *Sahābah* and those who followed them, are filled with this meaning; that *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* means the worthiness of worship for Allāh alone.
So no-one can claim ignorance in this issue, rather the one who is ignorant or misguided in this issue due to following something else than these sources, then he has only himself to
blame, and on the Day of Judgment he will not be excused for committing *shirk* with Allāh.

Abū Muhammad Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And know – may Allāh have mercy upon you – that the religion is what has come from Allāh –tabāraka wa ta’ālā – and it was not put upon the intellects of men and their opinions. And its (i.e.
the religion) knowledge is with Allāh and with His Messenger, so do not follow anything with you desires so you will pass through the religion and leave Islām, because there is no excuse for you.
Verily did the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) clarify the Sunnah for his Ummah and he made it clear for his Companions, and they are the Jamā’ah, and they are As-Sawād Al-
A’dham, and As-Sawād Al-A’dham is the truth and its people. So whoever opposes the companions of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) in anything from issues of the religion then he has committed kufr."* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)

The best of all good deeds is Tawhīd (worshipping Allāh alone) while the worst of all evil deeds is *shirk* (worshipping others than Allāh).

## The first pillar: *Al-Kufr bit-Tāghūt* (the rejection of *tāghūt*)

First of all *tāghūt* means someone who has transgressed his, hers or its boundaries. In the Islāmic context *tāghūt* means something which has transgressed its boundaries by being
worshipped, obeyed or followed besides Allāh. This does not apply for the one who is not pleased with being worshipped and disassociates himself from this worship.

Ibn Wahb (d. 197h) said:

*"Mālik (i.e. Imām Mālik) said to me: ‘At-Tāghūt is what they worship besides Allāh."* (Tafsīr Ibn Abū Hātim)

The head of all *tawāghīt* (pl. *tāghūt*) is Iblīs who is the Shaytān (devil). He refused to obey Allāh in prostrating to Ādam when Allāh created him with His two Hands. Thus he was
expelled from Paradise, rejected, humiliated and cursed, and he swore to mislead as many from the children of Ādam as possible by making them commit *shirk, kufr* and sins. Many
will follow his encouragements to evil, and on the Day of Resurrection he will disassociate himself from those whom he misled and he will not be able to help them with anything.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”When your Lord said to the angels: ‘I will verily create a person from clay. So when I have made him and breath into him (his) soul I have created, then fall down in
prostration to him. So the angels prostrated all of them. Except Iblīs he was arrogant and was among the disbelievers. He (i.e. Allāh) said: ‘O Iblīs, what prevented you from
prostrating to what I have created with My two Hands? Did you become too arrogant (to prostrate) or were you (already) among the haughty?’ He said: ‘I am better than him, You
have created me from fire and You created him from clay.’ He said: ‘Then go out from it (i.e. Paradise), because you are verily expelled. And verily is My curse upon you until the
Day of Judgment.’ He said: ‘My Lord, then give me respite until the Day they are resurrected.’ He said: ‘Then you are verily among those given respite. Until the Day of
an appointed time.’ He said: ‘By Your Might, I will verily lead them all astray. Except your slaves among them who have been given sincerity (in the worship of You).”** (Sād 38:71-83)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”As the example of the *Shaytān* when he says to the human: ‘Commit *kufr.*’ Then when he commits *kufr* he says: ‘I am verily free from you, I verily fear Allāh the Lord of all the worlds.”** (Al-Hashr 59:16)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And the *Shaytān* said when the affairs have been decided (on the Day of Resurrection): ‘Verily Allāh promised you a promise of truth, and I also promised you but I broke my
promise to you. And I did not have any authority over you except that I invited you (to evil) and then you answered me (voluntarily). So do not blame me, and blame
yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I verily reject when you associated me as a partner (with Allāh in worship) before. Verily the unjust will have a painful punishment.’”** (Ibrāhīm 14:22)

Some examples of *tāghūt* which are found today are the following:

* The one who is worshipped besides Allāh or is satisfied with being worshipped with any type of worship. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”Have I not enjoined upon you, O son of Ādam, that you should not worship the *Shaytān*? He is verily a clear enemy for you.”** (Yāsīn 36:60)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”And whoever among them says: ‘I am verily an *ilāh* (deity) besides Him’, such a person We will recompense with Hellfire. Such do we recompense the unjust.”** (Al-Anbiyā 21:29)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And verily, We have sent among every *Ummah*** (nation) **a Messenger** (proclaiming): **‘Worship Allāh** (Alone), **and avoid** (or keep away from) ***tāghūt*** (everything worshipped **besides Allāh).’”** (An-Nahl 16:36)

* The one who changes the *hukm* (judgment) of Allāh, such as the one who gives a *fatwā (verdict) or passes a law stating that *zinā* (fornication) is allowed, or he says that the one who commits *shirk* is a Muslim. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“Have you not seen those who claim to believe in what was revealed to you and what was revealed to those who came before you, they wish to seek judgment with the
*tāghūt*, and they were verily ordered to reject them. And the *Shaytān* wishes to misguide them into a great misguidance.”** (An-Nisā 4:60)

* The one who judges or rules between people with man-made laws that contradict the *Sharī’ah* and have its basis in other legislations than the *Sharī’ah.* Such as presidents,
  parliamentarians, political leaders and everyone who takes part in legislative bodies whose foundation is other than the Shari’ah, such as democracy, secularism, communism etc. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And whoever does not judge with what Allāh has revealed, then these are the disbelievers.”** (Al-Māidah 5:44)

* The one who claims to know the unseen, so people come and ask him about that. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“Say: ‘Those who are in the heavens and the earth do not know the unseen, except Allāh.”** (An-Naml 27:65)

* The one whom people believe can benefit and harm like Allāh can benefit and harm, so they ask him for benefit and seek refuge with him from harm, and he does not reject this, or the dead people in the graves and tombs whom are sought and invoked in these issues.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“He invokes besides Allāh, that which does not harm him and that which does not benefit him. That is the far away misguidance.”** (Al-Hajj 22:12)

* Nationalism, when people love and hate, and ally and show enmity based upon nationality and not for the sake of Allāh, then nationality has become a *tāghūt* for them
  which they worship. And this is when a person prefers the disbelieving people of his own nationality over the Muslims, and helps them against them and claims that they are better than the Muslims due to their nationality.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”O you who believe, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies, they are verily the allies of one another. And whoever of you takes them as allies, then he is verily one of them. Verily Allāh does not guide an unjust people.”** (Al-Māidah 5:51)

* Whims and desires. Many ignorant people say: *"I feel that if I do this and that then I am a good person and Allāh will not punish me."* This, while he is performing things that nullify his
  Islām. With this he has made his own whims and desires his *ilāh*, due to believing in it rather than believing in the Islāmic texts. He also becomes a *kāfir* and a worshipper of his
  own desires, if he commits sins due to the belief that the *Sharī’ah* is not binding upon him, or he changes the judgments according to his desires.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”Have you seen the one who takes his desires as his *ilāh* (worshipped one)?”** (Al-Furqān 25:43)

The detailed meaning of ***al-kufr bit-tāghūt*** can be found in the following verses:

**“Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrāhīm and those with him, when they said to their people: ‘Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship
besides Allāh, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred for ever, until you believe in Allāh Alone.’”** (Al-Mumtahanah 60:4)

And His – the Exalted – words:

**“That is because Allāh He is the Truth, and that which they invoke besides Him is the falsehood. And that Allāh He is Most High, the Great.”** (Al-Hajj 22:62)

And His – the Exalted – words:

**“And they worship besides Allāh that which do not benefit them nor harm them. And the disbeliever is ever a helper (of the Shaytān) against his Lord."** (Al-Furqān 25:55)

And that which is required is:

- Leaving the worship of the *tāghūt*.
- The rejection of the divinity for *tāghūt*, because they are falsehood.
- The rejection of the worship performed to *tāghūt* by believing it is invalid and void and that the *tāghūt* does not bring about benefit or harm.
- The rejection of those who worship *tāghūt* by knowing they are not Muslims.
- Hating these people and what they worship.
- Having enmity towards them.

And as for saying to a *mushrik* (one who commits *shirk*) to his face that he is a *mushrik* or a *kāfir*, or showing him enmity and hatred openly in speech and deeds, then this is
dependent upon the principle of *masālih* (benefits) and *mafāsid* (harms) according to the rules of the *Sharī’ah.*

That which is enough for a person to be a Muwahhid (one who only worships Allāh) is, that he leaves the worship of *tāghūt*, he rejects divinity for them, he knows that the *tāghūt*
neither brings benefit nor harm through the worship of them [Naturally the one who worships the *tāghūt* and dies upon this, will suffer the great harm of entering and
remaining in Hellfire forever. What is meant here is that the worshipped *tāghūt* cannot cause harm to the slave in this life, just as he cannot benefit him. Rather all harm and benefit is a decree from Allāh.], and that he knows and
believes that whoever worships something else than Allāh, then he is a *mushrik* and not a Muslim, and that he hates the *mushrikūn* (those who commit *shirk*).

Whoever does not fulfill this pillar as it has been described he has not rejected *tāghūt,* and by that he is a *mushrik* and not a Muslim.

And the best way of learning *al-kufr bit-tāghūt* is acquiring knowledge about Allāh, the belief in Him, the worship of Him, His Names and His Attributes and then not dedicating any of this to others than Him the Most High.

## Declaring *takfīr* upon the *mushrik*

Allāh has created mankind upon *fitrah* (natural disposition) through which they know their Lord and His Tawhīd [This does not apply to the Names and Attributes of Allāh which can only be known through the texts of Qurān and *Sunnah.* This is mentioned in the section of Tawhīd Al-Asmā was-Sifāt.] . Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And** (remember) **when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Ādam, from their loins, their seed** (or from Ādam’s loin his offspring) **and made them testify as to
themselves** (saying): **‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said: ‘Yes, we testify.’ In order for you not to say on the Day of Resurrection: ‘Verily, we have been unaware of this.’ Or that
you would say: ‘Verily did our forefathers commit shirk before, and we were** (merely) **offspring after them. So will you destroy us for something which the doers of falsehood did?”** (Al-A’rāf 7:172-173)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“So direct your face toward the religion, *hanīf*** (i.e. free from shirk)**.** (This is) **the *fitrah* of Allāh upon which He has created all people. No change should there be in the creation of Allāh. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.”** (Ar-Rūm 30:30)

Through the *fitrah* a person knows the ugliness of *shirk* and that only Allāh is worthy of worship. He furthermore knows that the one who worships other than Allāh is not a
Muslim who only worships One God. Thus, if you ask a person – who has not been corrupted by the doubts and arguments of *Shaytān* and his disciple among mankind – if
the person worshipping others than Allāh is a monotheist, he will surely say: 'No‛. And whoever is not a monotheist, then he inevitably is a polytheist (i.e. a *mushrik).

Furthermore, when the first pillar of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* is leaving the worship of *tāghūt* (anything which is worshipped besides Allāh), then the one who commits *shirk* by
worshipping the *tāghūt,* naturally has not fulfilled this pillar of the testimony and his testimony is invalid, just as if a person would leave out making *sujūd* in his prayer, then his prayer would also be invalid due to not having fulfilled a pillar of the prayer.

Add to this that in the Arabic language the one who performs the deed of shirk, by worshipping others than Allāh, he is given the name *mushrik.* And only a person who does not know the rules of the Arabic language refuses to name the person committing shirk as a *mushrik.*

And the conclusion is, that the one who refuses to declare *takfīr* upon the *mushrik* (i.e. he refuses to consider the person committing *shirk* as being a non-muslim), he has opposed
the *fitrah,* the evidences, the language and common sense. Allāh – the Exalted – testified to and explained this fact when He clarified the impossibility of the one worshipping only Allāh being equal to the one worshipping others along with Allāh:

**“Allāh gave an example of a** (slave) **man belonging to many partners disputing with one another, and a** (slave) **man belonging entirely to one master. Are those two equal in comparison? All praise is due to Allāh. But most of them do not know.”** (Az-Zumar 39:29)

At-Tabarī (d. 310h) said in his *tafsīr* of this verse:

*"He – exalted is His mention – says: Allāh gave an example of the kāfir billāh (disbeliever in Allāh) who worships different deities, and obeys a group of the shayātīn (devils). And (an example) of the believer who do not worship anyone besides Allāh." (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

And he also mentioned in his *tafsīr* of the verse:

*"Bishr narrated to us and said: Yazīd narrated to us and said: Sa’īd narrated to us, from Qatādah (regarding) His words:* **"Allāh gave an example of a (slave) man belonging to many
partners disputing with one another."** *He said: ‘This is the mushrik regarding whom the shayātīn (devils) dispute, none of them acknowledges him (as belonging) to anyone among them.*
**"And a (slave) man belonging entirely to one master."** *He said: ‘This is the believer who sincerily devotes the invocation and worship (to Allāh).’"* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

As for telling the *mushrik* to his face that he is not a Muslim, then this is not a must for having fulfilled the *takfīr*, but it is a must that he believes that the one who commits *shirk* is
upon *kufr* and not upon Islām. Allāh has clearly described the one who ascribes partners and rivals with Allāh in worship as being upon *kufr,* when He – the Exalted – said:

**“And he sets up rivals to Allāh, in order to mislead others from His Path. Say: ‘Take pleasure in your *kufr*** (disbelief) **for a while: surely, you are among the dwellers of Hellfire.”** (Az-Zumar 39:8)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And whoever invokes** (or worships), **besides Allāh, any other ilāh** (deity), **of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Verily the *kāfirūn*** (the disbelievers) **will not be successful.”** (Al-Muminūn 23:117)

And the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) also testified that whoever dies upon *shirk,* he will enter Hellfire. And no-one enters Hellfire forever except a *kāfir.* ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas’ūd (رضي الله عنه) said:

**"*The Prophet (ﷺ) said one thing, and I said another thing. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Wheoever dies, and he is invoking a rival besides Allāh, he will enter Hellfire.’ And I said: ‘Whoever dies, and he does not invoke a rival with Allāh, he will enter Paradise."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

Add to this that the Prophet (ﷺ) would connect the *hukm* (judgment) of Islām in *dunyā* with the fact that a person does not worship anything else
but Allāh [This is in what is showed publicly. If he hides his *shirk* and *kufr* and shows Islām outwardly, then he is munāfiq and the judgment of Islām is still applied upon him.].

The Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) said:

***"Whoever says: Lā ilāha illa Allāh and rejects everything which is worshipped besides Allāh, his wealth and blood becomes impermissible (to take) and his account is with
Allāh."*** And in another version: ***"Whoever singles out Allāh (in worship)."*** And then he mentioned the same. (Sahīh Muslim)

So the condition for acquiring the *hukm* (judgment) of Islām in *dunyā* is that he testifies to *Lā ilahā illa Allāh* and that he rejects everything which is worshipped besides Allāh, by not
worshipping it. Thus, if he worships something else than Allāh – or shows another *nāqid* (nullifier) among the *nawāqid* of Islām – then the judgment of Islām is removed from him,
due to him not having fulfilled the conditions for acquiring this judgment. So the issue of *takfīr al-mushrik* (declaring *takfīr* upon the one who commits *shirk*) is very
easy for the people of truth, since the answer to this issue is clearly stated in the Qurān and the *Sunnah.*

Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And no-one from the people of the Qiblah (i.e. those who pray) are exited from Islām (i.e. declared takfīr upon) before he rejects a verse from the Book of Allāh – the Exalted – or he rejects something
of the narrations of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), or he prays to other than Allāh, or he slaughters for others than Allāh. But if he does any of these things, then it is obligatory upon you to exit him from Islām."* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)


## Excuse in ignorance and the one who considers the *mushrik* a Muslim

Allāh did not excuse a person in ignorance, neither did His Messenger (ﷺ) and therefore a Muslim also do not excuse the one who commits *shirk* due to ignorance.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And if anyone of the *mushrikūn*** (those who commit *shirk*) **seeks your protection then grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allāh** (i.e. the Qurān), **and then
escort him to where he can be secure, that is because they are men who know not.”** (At-Tawbah 9:6)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Those who disbelieve from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and among the *mushrikūn,* were not going to leave (their disbelief) until the clear evidence comes to them.”** (Al-Bayyinah 98:1)

In both of these verses Allāh gives the name *mushrik* to those who ascribe partners and rivals to Him in worship before the evidence having reached them, being the Qurān and
the Messenger (ﷺ). So if these people were not excused how can anyone claim that a person who claims to be a Muslim, recites the Qurān, mentions the
ahādīth and lives among the Muslims, is entitled to being excused when Allāh did not excuse those whom the Book and Messenger did not reach yet?

Furthermore the Prophet (ﷺ) said in a sahīh hadīth narrated by Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه):

***"By the One whose Hand Muhammad’s soul is in, no-one from this Ummah, neither a Jew nor a Christian hears about me, and then do not believe in what I have been sent with, except that he is from the people of the fire."*** (Sahīh Muslim)


So whoever among the Jews, Christians, Majūs, Buddhists, Atheists and all others in this life who heard about the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) and then dies
upon something else than the Tawhīd of Allāh and the Risālah of Muhammad (ﷺ), then he will be in Hellfire. Then how daring and how ignorant is it, to claim that a person who claims to be a Muslim and then breaches his Tawhīd by
committing *shirk* is excused while the above mentioned are going to Hellfire?

Add to this that if a person should pray his prayer while being ignorant about the fact that the prayer contains the performance of *sujūd* so he does not perform it, then his prayer is
still not valid even if he was ignorant. And likewise is it with Tawhīd. Even if he was ignorant of only one type of shirk and he performed it, then he is not excused with his
ignorance and his testimony of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* is not valid until he acquires the required knowledge and corrects his beliefs and disassociates himself from the shirk which he performed.

This is because knowledge about Allāh and His Tawhīd is *fard ‘ayn* (an obligation upon every single person), and no-one is excused from this obligation if he is of sane mind.

So the one who commits *shirk* and dies upon it without having repented and disassociated himself from it and its people, he will enter Hellfire according to the promise of Allāh – the Exalted – Who does not break His promise.

Allāh – the Exalted said:

**”Verily whoever commits *shirk*** (i.e. associates partners with Allāh in worship), **then Allāh has verily made Paradise forbidden for him, and his abode will be the fire. And the unjust will have no helpers.”** (Al-Maidah 5:72)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Verily Allāh does not forgive that partners are associated with Him** (in worship), **and He forgives whatever is besides that for whoever He wills. And whoever commit *shirk* with Allāh, then he has verily gone far astray.”** (An-Nisa 4:116)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said in a sahīh hadīth narrated by Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه):

***"(On Judgment Day) a caller will call: ‘Verily every Ummah must follow what it used to worship (in dunyā).’ So the shayātīn, the cross and their awliyā are followed to Hellfire.
And we will remain, O you believers. Then our Lord will come to us and say: ‘Upon what are these?’ So we will say: ‘We are the slaves of Allāh the believers. We have believed in
our Lord and we did not associate anything with Him (in worship), and He is our Lord – tabāraka wa ta’ālā – and He will come to us and He will make us firm, and this is our
place until our Lord will come to us.’ Then He will say: ‘I am your Lord, so go forth.’"*** (At- Tawhīd by Ibn Khuzaymah – with a firm and correct chain of narration)

So whoever dies upon *shirk* after the Qurān has reached him, he will be in Hellfire. That is regarding his punishment in *al-ākhirah* (the hereafter). But in *dunyā* he is *mushrik* regardless
of the Qurān reaching him or not, because he worships others than Allāh and not Allāh alone.

At-Tabarī (d. 310h) said in his tafsīr of the verse:

*"He – Exalted is His mention – says: Verily the group for whom the misguidance became a reality, they verily went astray from the Path of Allāh and deviated from the intended goal, by taking the
shayātīn as supporters and helpers besided Allāh, due to ignorance from them regarding the mistake they are upon in this. Rather they did this while they were thinking they are upon guidance and the
truth, and that the correct is what they have come with and performed. And this (verse) is among the clearest of evidences for the mistake of the opinion of the one who claims that Allāh will not
punish anyone for a sin which he performed or a misguidance which he believed in, except if he performs (or believes in) it after having knowledge about its correct reality and then he performs it out of stubbornness from him towards his Lord."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

And the same meaning is found in the following verses:

**”Say: ‘Shall we inform you about the biggest losers with regards to their deeds?** (They are) **those whose efforts in this life were wasted while they were thinking that they were doing good.’”** (Al-Kahf 18:103-104)

At-Tabarī said in his *tafsīr* of this verse:

*"And this (verse) is among the clearest of evidences for the mistake of the opinion of the one who claims that no-one commits kufr to Allāh, except if he intends to commit kufr after having
knowledge about His wahdāniyyah (oneness). And this is because Allāh – Exalted is His mention – informed about these people whom He described in this verse, that their efforts which they did in
dunyā went astray, and they were verily thinking that they were doing good in this. And He informed that they are those who committed kufr in the verses of their Lord. And if the (correct)
opinion were as the one who claims that no-one commits kufr to Allāh except when he knows (it is kufr), then this necessitates that these people (mentioned in the verse) in their deeds – which He
informed that they were thinking that they were doing good in – were rewarded and recompensed for it. But the opinion is opposite of what they say. So He – Exalted is His praise – informed about them that they are disbelievers in Allāh, and that their deeds are in vain."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

Thus, the one who excuses the *mushrik* in ignorance – or any other excuse – and declares him a Muslim, he himself is not a Muslim due to the following:

* His testimony of _Lā ilāha illa Allāh_ is not valid since the first condition for the validity of the testimony is knowledge. So he must know the meaning of the testimony, what it
  necessitates and what contradicts it. And the person who does not know that the one who commits _shirk_ is not a Muslim, he has in reality not known the meaning of *Lā ilāha illa
  Allāh,* which is to worship Allāh alone and not ascribing partners to Him in worship. Rather in his understanding of Islām a person can be a Muslim without rejecting *tāghūt,*
  while Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”And those who avoid *tāghūt* by not worshipping it and turn in repentance to Allah, for them are the glad tidings** (of Paradise). **So give the glad tidings to My slaves.”** (Az-Zumar 39:17)

* He has not rejected *tāghūt* which is the first pillar that must be fulfilled in order for his testimony of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* to be valid. And this is because it is included in *al-kufr bit-
  tāghūt,* to consider the one who worships *tāghūt* as a non-Muslim. And the evidence for this is the words of Allāh the Exalted:

**”Say: ’O you disbelievers. I do not worship what you worship. Nor do you worship what I worship. Nor will I** (ever) **worship what you worship. Nor will you worship what I worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.’”** (Al-Kāfirūn)

The Prophet (ﷺ) said about this Sūrah:

***"Verily it is the disassociation from shirk."*** (Sahīh Ibn Hibbān)

And by this we learn that the disassociation from shirk and the rejection of *tāghūt* includes:

1. The disassociation from what is worshipped. **“I do not worship what you worship.”**
2. The disassociation from the worship itself. **“For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.”**  And verily is the religion worship.
3. The disassociation from the worshipper. **“Say: ’O you disbelievers.’”**

* He has entered into the major *walā* (alliance, loyalty, love) with the *mushrikūn,* by considering them as Muslim, by which the *walā* to them becomes obligatory upon him.
  Having this form of *walā* is *kufr* which brings a person out of Islām, due to words of Allāh the Exalted:

**” And whoever of you takes them as allies, then he is verily one of them. Verily Allāh does not guide an unjust people.”** (Al-Māidah 5:51)

* He (i.e. the one who considers the *mushrik* a Muslim) has furthermore rejected describing a person with *kufr* whom Allāh has described with *kufr*. And the one who rejects even one verse from the Qurān, he is *kāfir*.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“Yes! Verily, there came to you My *āyāt*** (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs) **and you denied them, and were proud and were among the disbelievers.”** (Az-Zumar 39:59)

So just like declaring *takfīr* upon the *mushrik* is necessary for you in order to have fulfilled your *kufr bit-tāghūt*, then it is naturally also necessary for the next man in order for his *kufr
bit-tāghūt* to be valid. So the *hukm* of the one who considers the *mushrik* a Muslim is that he did not fulfill his *kufr bit-tāghūt* and therefore he has not fulfilled *Lā ilāha illa Allāh*, and by that he is not a Muslim.

## The second pillar: *Al-Imānu billāh* (the belief in Allāh)

Believing in Allāh – in the language – means to acknowledge the presence of a Creator and Sustainer etc. And this is the belief which is mentioned in the following verse:

**“And most of them do not believe in Allāh, except that they are mushrikūn** (i.e. associating partners with Allāh in worship)**.”** (Yūsuf 12:106)

But this type of belief is not sufficient for becoming a Muslim, rather a Muslim must believe in Allāh according to the Islāmic Legislation, and not just according to the
language. This belief in Allāh is called At-Tawhīd (The Oneness of Allāh). This is the type of belief which is mentioned in the following verse:

**“Those who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice** (i.e. shirk)**, for those there is safety and they are the rightly guided.”** (Al-An’ām 6:82)

‘Abdullāh ibn Mas’ūd (رضي الله عنه) said:

*"When the verse: **"Those who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice** (i.e. shirk)**, for those there is safety and they are the rightly guided."** was revealed this was hard
(to hear) for the Muslims. So they said: ‘O Messenger of Allāh, who of us does not make injustice to himself (by sinning)?’ He said: ‘That is not what is meant. Verily it is shirk. Did you not hear what
Luqmān said to his son while he was advising him: **"O my son, do not commit shirk to Allāh. Verily shirk is a big injustice."**"* (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

In order to make it easier for the people, Tawhīd has been divided into three categories which are:

**1. Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah*,** which means the Tawhīd of Lordship. This type of Tawhīd includes the slave’s belief in the actions of Allāh.

**2. Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah***, which means the Tawhīd of Divinity (or Worship). This type of Tawhīd includes the slave’s deeds which he performs to worship Allāh.

**3. Tawhīd *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt*,** which means the Tawhīd of Names and Attributes. This type of Tawhīd includes the descriptions of Allāhs Names and Attributes which are found in the Qurān and in the Sunnah.

Muhammad ibn Nasr Al-Marwazī (d. 294h) said when explaining *īmān*:

*"Then its asl (fundament) is the acknowledgement of the heart regarding the knowledge (about Allāh and His religion). And this is the submission to Allāh in the ‘ubūdiyyah (worship), and the
submission to Him in the Rubūbiyyah (Lordship). And likewise the submission of the tongue by acknowledging the ilāhiyyah (divinity) by having sincerity for Him in the heart and upon the
tongue (regarding) Him being One without any partner."* (Ta’dhīm Qadr As-Salāh by Al-Marwazī 2/702)

And Imām Ahmad ibn Hanbāl (d. 241h) said:

*"We worship Allāh by His Attributes, just as He has described Himself. He has verily outlined the description of Himself. And we do not transgress the Qurān and the hadīth, so we say just as they
have said, and we describe Him just as He has described Himself and we do not transgress (or invalidate) this. We believe in all of the Qurān, both that of it which is clear and that which is dubious, and we do not remove from Him – uplifted is His mention – any Attribute from His Attributes."* (Al-Ibānah Al-Kubrā by Ibn Battah)

And Ibn Battah (d. 387 h) said:

*"And this is because the asl (foundation) of īmān in Allāh – which is obligatory upon the creation to believe in regarding the establishment of the belief in Him – are in three things. The first: That the
slave believes in His Lordship in order for him to be free from the madhhab of the people of ta’tīl (invalidation) who do not establish (or believe in) a creator. The second: That he believes in His
Oneness in order for him to free from the madhāhib of the people of shirk who acknowledged a Creator but associated others as partners with Him in worship. The third: That he believes that He
is described with the Attributes which it is not possible except that He is described with them such as knowledge, capability, wisdom and the rest of what He has described Himself with in His Book.
Since we have verily known that many of those who acknowledge Him and unify Him in worship in general words verily deviate in His Attributes, and then his deviation in His Attributes is a breach
in his Tawhīd. And because we find that Allāh – the Exalted – verily has addressed His slaves by calling them to believing in every one of these three and the īmān in them."* (Al-Ibānah ‘an Sharī’ah Al-Firqah An-Nājiyah)

So a person cannot be a Muslim without believing in and performing all three types of Tawhīd without associating partners with Allāh in any of these, or if he believes in them in
a way which is contradictory to what is stated in the Qurān and the *Sunnah* according to the understanding of the *Salaf*. And verily did Allāh – the Exalted – gather all three types of Tawhīd in His words:

**”The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, so worship Him and be steadfast in the worship of Him. Do you know anyone equal to Him in name (i.e. someone sharing His Names and Attributes)?”** (Maryam19:65)

At-Tabarī (d. 718h) mentioned in his *tafsīr* of the verse:

*"Bishr narrated to us and said: Yazid narrated to us and said: Sa’id narrated to us, from Qatadah (regarding) His words:* **"Do you know anyone equal to Him in name?"** *(He said:) ‘There is
no-one equal to him in name and nor is anyone similar to Him. All of His creation acknowledge Him and recognize that He is his creator and know this.’ Then he read this verse:* **"And if you
asked them who created them, they will verily say: ‘Allah’."** (Az-Zukhruf 43:87).‛ (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

The people whom the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) were sent amongst (i.e. the *kuffār* of Quraysh), believed in Allāh, but only in some aspects of His *Rubūbiyyah*.
So they acknowledged Allāh as their Creator and Sustainer, and they performed several types of worship for Him. But due to them worshipping the statues besides Him, by
invoking them and taking them as intermediaries between themselves and Allāh, then Allāh rejected their socalled īmān and sent His Prophet (ﷺ) to warn them.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”Say: ‘To whom belongs the earth and whatever is in it, if you** (really) **know?’ Then they will say: ‘To Allāh’. Say: ‘Will you then not be reminded?’ Say: ‘Who is the Lord of the
seven heavens and the Lord of the Mighty Throne?’ They will say: ‘Allāh is.’ Say: ‘Will you then not fear** (Allāh)**?’ Say: ‘In whose Hand is the sovereignty over everything, and
He protects while nothing protects against Him, if you really know?’ They will say: ‘Allāh.’ Say: ‘Then how are you deceived** (away from worshipping only Him)**?’”** (Al- Muminūn 23:84-89)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And if you would ask them: ‘Who sends down water from the sky with which He brings the earth back to life after its death?’ Then they would verily say: ‘Allāh** (does)**.’ Say: ‘All praise is due to Allāh, but most of them do not understand.”** (Al-‘Ankabūt 29:63)

So a person may claim night and day that he is a believer in Allāh, and he may perform lots of worship for Allāh, but if his *īmān* is not according the the Islāmic Legislation so that
he has fulfilled the three types of Tawhīd, then his *īmān* is invalid and Allāh does not accept it.

## Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah* (Tawhīd of Lordship)

Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah* is the belief in Oneness of Allāh in the Creation, the Lordship, the Arrangement, and His Oneness in His Actions. Those who commit *shirk* believe in many
aspects of this type of Tawhīd, yet it is not enough to save them from the punishment of Allāh, because they worship others than Allāh. This was the situation of the *kuffār*
(disbelievers) of Quraysh [Quraysh is the tribe of the Prophet (ﷺ)] which has previously been mentioned. The description of Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah* can be found in the following verses.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“Say** (O Muhammad)**: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? And who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the
dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?’ They will say: ‘Allāh.’ Say: ‘Will you not then be afraid?’ ”** (Yūnus 10:31)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Allāh is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then, He rose above the Throne** (in a manner that suits His Majesty)**. He has subjected the sun and the
moon, each of them running** (its course) **for a term appointed. He regulates all affairs, explaining the *āyāt*** (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs) **in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord.”** (Ar-Ra’d 13:2)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Surely, His is the Creation and Commandment. Blessed be Allāh, the Lord of *Al- ‘Ālamīn*** (all that exists)**.”** (Al-A’rāf 7:54)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And if you asked them who created them, they will surely say: ‘Allāh’. How then are they turned away** (from the worship of Allāh alone)**?”** (Az-Zukhruf 43:87)

And this type of Tawhīd is the reason that only Allāh deserves to be worshipped and no-one else but Him. He is our Lord and Creator, and therefore He is the one who deserves that we worship Him. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“O mankind, worship your Lord, Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become God-fearing.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:21)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”That is Allāh your Lord. There is no-one worthy of worship besides Him. The Creator of everything, so worship Him. And He is the Disposer of all things.”** (Al-An’ām 6:102)

The One who Creates, Provides, Sustains, Benefits, Harms, Upholds, Maintains, Knows, Gives life, Takes life, Legislates, Forgives, Punishes, Decrees, Protects, Cures, Clothes,
Feeds, Exposes, Hides, Honors, Humiliates, Destroys, Shows mercy and Answers His slaves, is the One who deserves to be worshipped. And naturally those who cannot do any
of these things – and do not own any partnership with Allah nor do they help Him in any it – are not in any way entitled that even the smallest type of worship should be dedicated
towards them. And these things mentioned above are all from the Actions of Allāh, which are specific for Him – the Exalted – and they are the reason that He Alone is deserving of being worshipped and no-one else but Him the Most High. He – the Exalted – said:

**”Say invoke those whom you claim (to be gods) besides Allah. They do not own** (even) **an atom’s weight in the heavens, nor on earth. And they do not hold any partnership** (with Allah) **in any of them, nor does He have any helper from among them.”** (Saba 34:22)

## *Shirk* in Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah*

Among the types of *shirk* which people commit in this type of Tawhīd are the following:

* Believing that something else created the creation.

* Believing that someone else than Allāh can harm or benefit, such as a person in a grave, a living person (in things which humans are not capable of), the position of the stars on the sky etc.

* Believing that someone else has the right to legislate for people. Legislating is the right of Allāh and it is from His actions. So believing that someone else has this right is ascribing him as a partner or rival with Allāh in this specific action of Allāh.

* Believing that someone besides Allāh can affect the affairs of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them.

* Believing that someone besides Allāh knows the unseen. Knowing the unseen is a specific characteristic of Allāh and therefore whoever believes someone else knows what
  only Allāh knows, then he has ascribed a partner or a rival to Allāh in this specific characteristic.

Whoever ascribes anything which is from Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah* to others than Allāh then he has committed shirk in Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah* and by this he leaves the fold of Islām and becomes a mushrik.

## Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah* (Tawhīd of divinity or worship)

Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah* is the realization of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh*. That which all the prophets and messenger was sent to invite towards. And this is dedicating all types of worship solely to Allāh and not to anyone but Him.

As for worship then it is a comprehensive term that includes all inwardly and outwardly sayings and deeds which Allāh is pleased with and which He loves. It is the slave’s
humbleness and submissiveness towards His Lord, by performing that which He has obliged upon him and avoiding that which He has prohibited for him. The purpose of the creation of mankind and jinn is that they should worship Allāh Alone.

He – the Exalted – said:

**“And I created not the *jinn* and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).”** (Adh-Dhāriyāt 51:56)

Among the types of worship which must be directed solely to Allāh, are the following:

* *As-Salāh* (the prayer): **”And establish the prayer and give the zakah.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:43)
* *Rukū’* (bowing) and sujūd (prostrating): **”O you who believe, perform ruku’ and sujud”** (Al-Hajj 22:77)
* *Ad-Du’ā* (the invocation): **”And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me and I will answer you.’”** (Al-Ghāfir 40:60)
* *Adh-Dhabh* (the slaughtering): **”So pray to your Lord and slaughter (for Him).”** (Al-Kawthar 108:2)
* *Al-Khawf* (the fear) of Allāh: **”It is only the *Shaytān* that suggests to you the fear of his allies, so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true) believers.”** (Āli ’Imrān 3:175)
* *At-Tawakkul* (putting your trust in Allāh): **”And put your trust in Allāh if you are** (true) **believers”** (Al-Māidah 5:23)
* *Al-Istighfār* (asking for forgiveness): **”And ask your Lord for forgiveness and turn unto Him in repentance. Verily, my Lord is Most Merciful, Most Loving.”** (Hūd 11:90)
* *Al-Inābah* (turning in repentance): **”And turn in repentance to your Lord and submit yourselves to Him, before the torment comes upon you, then you will not be helped.”** (Az-Zumar 39:54)
* *Al-Isti’ādhah* (seeking refuge): **”Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the daybreak.”** (Al-Falaq 113:1)
* *Al-Jihād* (striving) with life and wealth: **”March forth, whether you are light** (being healthy, young and wealthy) **or heavy** (being ill, old and poor)**, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the Cause of Allāh.”** (At-Tawbah 9:41)
* *Al-Hukm* (the judgment) between people with what Allāh has revealed: **“And so judge** (you O Muhammad) **between them by what Allāh has revealed and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they turn you away from some of that which Allāh has revealed to you.”** (Al-Māidah 5:49)

And He – the Exalted – said: **”Surely, We have sent down to you the Book in truth that you may judge between men by that which Allāh has shown you.”** (An-Nisā 4:105)
* *At-Tahākum* (seeking judgment) from Allāh and His Messenger: **”And if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, then refer it to Allāh and His Messenger, if you believe in Allāh and in the Last Day.”** (An-Nisā 4:59)

And He – the Exalted – said: **”And in whatsoever you differ, the *hukm*** (judgment) **thereof is with Allāh.”** (Ash-Shūrā 42:10)

And He – the Exalted – said: **”But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you** (O Muhammad) **judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept** (them) **with full submission.”** (An-Nisā 4:65)

* *At-Tā’ah* (obedience) to Allāh in what He has allowed and forbidden: **”So eat from that which the Name of Allāh has been mentioned upon, if you** (truly) **believe in His verses.”** (Al-An’ām 6:118)

And He – the Exalted – said: **”Verily, He has only forbidden the *maytah*** (dead animals) **for you, the blood, the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allāh.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:173)

So it is obedience – and thereby an act of worship – to consider what Allāh has made allowed as being allowed, and what Allāh has made forbidden as being forbidden.

* And from the types of worship are also: Loving for the sake of Allāh and hating for the sake of Allāh, giving for the sake of Allāh and withholding for the sake of Allāh, allying
  for the sake of Allāh and having enmity for the sake of Allāh, *Ar-Raghbah* (the wishing or longing), *Ar-Rahbah* (awe), *Al-Istighāthah* (asking for help), *Ash-Shukr* (gratitude), *Tilawatul-
  Qurān* (reciting the Qur’an), *Dhikr Allāh* (remembrance of Allāh) and *As-Siyām* (the fast) and other than this.

## *Shirk* in Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah*

*Shirk* in Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah* is dedicating some of the above mentioned types of worship – or others than these – to someone else than Allāh. And among the types of *shirk* which are widespread today are:

* Making *du’ā* to dead people in the graves. And the conditions for a du’ā (invocation, question, request) not being *shirk*, is that the one who is asked is (1) alive, (2) capable of
  what he is asked and (3) present at the time. If one of these three conditions are not present then the du’ā is *shirk* and takes the person out of Islām. Exactly what he asks the dead for
  is not important and does not determine whether or not is it *shirk*, since the dead is not able to do anything anyway.
* Making *du’ā* to the angels.
* Seeking refuge or protection with others than Allāh.
* Slaughtering for others than Allāh.
* Voting in democratic elections and thereby giving the right to legislate to others than Allāh.
* Seeking judgment in disputes with the courts that judges with manmade law.
* Believing something forbidden is allowed, or that something allowed is forbidden, based upon desires, traditions, others legislations than the *Sharī’ah* or the sayings of men. This is *shirk* in obedience.
* Striving in the cause of *tāghūt*, such as being a policeman or soldier for *tāghūt*.
* Aiding the *kuffār* against the Muslims with wealth, advice or weapons.

So whoever ascribes anything which is classified as worship in the Islāmic legislation to others than Allāh then he has committed shirk in Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah* and by this he leaves the fold of Islām and becomes a *mushrik*.
## Tawhid *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt* (Tawhīd of Names and Attributes)

Tawhid *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt* is the belief in the descriptions of Allāh which has come in the Qurān and the *ahādīth* from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) and the
sayings of the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) and those who narrated from them, without denying it, without distorting its meanings, without comparing Allāh with the creation
and without describing how. Rather a person must believe in what has been described in the way it has been described, and accept the narrations as they have been narrated in
order to avoid falling in *shirk* or *bida’* (innovation) in this type of Tawhīd. The basis for this, are the words of Allāh – the Exalted – who said:

**“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.”** (Ash-Shūrā 42:11)

So whatever Allāh or His Messenger (ﷺ) and the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) has informed us about, regarding the description of Allāh, then Allāh is alone in this description and He is not equal to His creation in any of it, even though
some words might be used for both Allāh and the slave, such as a *Karīm* (Generous) Lord and a *karīm* (generous) man. Because the generosity of the man is limited to what Allāh
has given him and dependent upon the decree of Allāh, while the Generosity of Allāh is unlimited, unrestrained and He spends out of His bounty on whom He wants however He wants.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allāh, so call on Him by them, and leave those who deny** (or utter impious speech against) **His Names. They will be recompensed for what they used to do.”** (Al-A’rāf 7:180)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Say** (O Muhammad)**: ‘Invoke Allāh or invoke Ar-Rahmān** (the Most Benificent)**. No matter by which Name you invoke Him, then to Him belong the Best Names.’”** (Al-Isrā 17:110)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“He is Allāh, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms. To Him belong the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”** (Al-Hashr 59:24)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Say** (O Muhammad)**: ‘He is Allāh,** (the) **One. Allāh is As-Samad** (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, while He needs no-one)**. He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is no equal to Him.’”** (Al-Ikhlās 112)

Some of Allāhs Names and Attributes are known from the *fitrah*, such as Allāh being the Creator who is Capable of everything, the Disposer of affairs, the Legislator, that Allāh
Sees and Hears, that Allāh Speaks whenever He wishes, that Allāh has Knowledge about everything, that Allāh has Life, that Allāh is in *‘Uluw* (i.e. above the heavens separated
from His creation) and similar to these things which describe Allāh with attributes of perfection and negate any flaws, mistakes or deficiency for Him the Exalted. Whoever rejects any of these or claims to ignorant about them, he is *kāfir*.

Then there are other things about Allāh which only can be known through a text from either the Qurān or *Sunnah* or the sayings of the *Sahābah*. These are things such as Allāh
descending to the lowest heaven every night, Allāh sits, Allāh laughs, Allāh has a flank and a chest, Allāh becomes amazed etc. These are things which can only be known
through the texts and therefore whoever rejects or is ignorant about these does not become a *kāfir* until the evidence is established upon him. Many of these issues the scholars spoke
of in their explanation and clarification of the *Sunnah*, which is mentioned in this book under the second testimony of ***Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh***, due to them being mentioned in the *Sunnah* of the Prophet (ﷺ) or in the words of the* Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم).

And regarding the Tawhīd of *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt* there are some points which must be understood in order for the slave to fulfill this type of Tawhīd in its desired form and which prove the correct understanding and implementation of this type of Tawhīd.

**1) The Tawhīd of *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt* and establishing the Attributes is from the *muhkamāt* (clear issues) and not from the *mutashābihāt* (unclear or doubious issues), and it is from the issues of *ijmā’* (scholarly agreement) and not from the issues of *ikhtilāf* (disagreement).**

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And Allāh spoke to Musa directly.”** (An-Nisā 4:164)

In this verse the Attribute of speaking *(kallama)* is confirmed with the root of the verb (i.e. *taklīman*), and in the Arabic language that which is confirmed with the root is impossible
to interpret to something else than the apparent meaning of the word. And this is a well- known fact even among the leaders of misguidance which they themselves affirm when they speak about the Arabic language.

Based upon this it is not allowed to interpret the Names and Attributes of Allāh to something else than their apparent meanings since they have been mentioned in a clear
and clarified way in the Book of Allāh and the *Sunnah* of His Messenger (ﷺ). Furthermore, there does not exist even one word from the *Salaf* in which they allow interpreting the Names and Attributes to something else than their apparent
meanings, or to claim that they are metaphorical and should not be understood according to their apparent meanings. So this also proves that this issue is an issue of *ijmā’* in which there is no disagreement at all.

Ibn Battah (d. 387h) said:

*"Verily the people of establishing (the Attributes) from the people of Sunnah are in agreement upon the acknowledgement of Tawhīd and the Risālah (Message); that the īmān is in speech, deeds and
intention and that the Qurān is the Word of Allāh and not created. And they agree upon that whatever Allāh wants will be and whatever He does not want will never be, that Allāh has created
both the good and evil and predestined it, that Allāh is seen on the Day of Resurrection, that Paradise and Hellfire are two creations which will remain by Allāh letting them remain, that Allāh
is upon His Throne separated from His creation and His knowledge encompasses everything, that Allāh is Eternal and has no beginning, no end and (His capabilities, Deeds and Attributes have) no
boundaries. With His perfect Attributes He has always been knowledgable, speaking, hearing, seeing, alive and forbearing. He knows what will be before it is, and (they agreed) that He
predestined the destinies before everything was created. And they are in agreement regarding the leadership (after the death of the Prophet (ﷺ)) of Abū Bakr, ‘Umar,
‘Uthmān and ‘Alī (رضي الله عنهم), and upon the preference of the two Shaykh (Abū Bakr and ‘Umar) and that the ten are in Paradise will full certainty and no doubt regarding it. And they are
in agreement regarding the tarahhum (asking for mercy) upon all the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) and asking for forgiveness for them, his wives, his children
and the people of his household, and not mentioning any of these except with good while refraining from and not looking into the disputes between them. So this (i.e. what has been mentioned) and
what is similar to it is from that which has a long explanation and the people since Allāh sent His Prophet (ﷺ) until this time of ours are in agreement regarding this, in
the east of the earth and in the west of it, in its seas and on its land, on its flat parts and in its mountains. The scholars and narrators of the āthār (narrations) narrate it and (so do) the people of
information, the people of manners and intelligence know it, and men, women, old, young, children, the young people from both the city and the desert, the Arabs and the non-Arabs all agree on this.
No-one disagrees with this, rejects it or deviates from the agreement of the people regarding this except a dirty, deviant, innovative, hated, forsaken, repelled man whom the scholars disassociate
from and the intelligent cut off. If he is sick they do not visit him and if he dies they do not witness his burial."* (Al-Ibānah ‘an Sharī’ah Al-Firqah An-Nājiyah)

So here it is clearly seen that the issues of the Names and Attributes of Allāh are considered included in the issues of agreement among both the scholars and also the regular of the Muslims.

**2) The way of *Ahlus-Sunnah* is establishing the mentioned Attribute in the Book and the *Sunnah* according to its real meaning, without *tahrīf* (distortion), *ta’tīl* (invalidation), *takyīf* (explaining) and *tamthīl* (comparing).**

Allah – the Exalted – said: **“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.”** (Ash-Shūrā 42:11)

In this verse the negation of the four forbidden things can be found. Because His words: **"There is nothing like Him"**, negates *takyīf* and *tamthīl* which is that the slaves explains
the condition of the Attribute of Allāh or that he compares the Attribute by saying ‘A Hand just like a hand’, or ‘Sight just like a sight’. And His words: **"And He is the All-
Hearer, the All-Seer"** negates *tahrīf* and ta’tīl, which is that the slave claims that the Sight of Allāh means His knowledge or that he completely rejects that Allah can see.

Ibn Mājishun (d. 18:h) said:

*"Know – may Allāh have mercy upon you – that the protection in the religion is stopping in religion where it stops with you and not to transgress that which has been limited for you. Because
it is verily from the foundation of the religion to know the good and reject the evil. So whatever has been explained to you of knowledge and the hearts find tranquility in it – while its foundation have
been mentioned in the Book and the Sunnah and the Ummah has inherited its knowledge – then do not fear any blame for mentioning it and its description from your Lord of what He has described
Himself with. And do not feel burdened by what He has described to you of that. And whatever your soul rejects and you do not find the mention of it in the Book of your Lord nor in the hadīth
from your Prophet (ﷺ) – of the mention of the description of your Lord – then do not burden your mind with the knowledge of it, and do not describe it with your tongue.
Remain silent about it just like the Lord has remained silent about it regarding Himself. For verily burdening yourself with the knowledge of what He has not described Himself with is just like
rejecting that which He has described. So just like you consider it a big thing what the rejectors have rejected of what He has described Himself with, then likewise consider it a big thing to burden ones self with what the describers have described of that which He has not described himself with."* (Al-Ibānah Al-Kubrā by Ibn Battah)

And Ibn Battah (d. 287h) said:

*"Know – may Allah have mercy upon you – that from the characteristics of the believers among the people of the truth is to believe in the correct narrations, receiving them with acceptance and to
refrain from opposing them with qiyās (analogy) and forming a view based upon opinions and desires. For verily is belief to accept and the believer is the one who accepts. Allah – ‘azza wa jalla –
said: **"But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you** (O Muhammad) **judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your
decisions, and accept** (them) **with full submission."** (An-Nisā 4:65) So from the signs of the believers is that they describe Allah with what He has described Himself with and with what His
Messenger (ﷺ) has described Him with from that which the scholars have conveyed, and what the trustworthy people of narration have narrated; those who are the hujjah
(argument) in what they narrated of halal, haram, the sunan and the athar. And regarding that which has been correctly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) it is
not said ‘how?’ nor ‘why?’, rather they follow and do not innovate, and they submit themselves and do not oppose, and they believe with certainty and they do not doubt nor are they skeptical."* (Al- Ibānah Al-Kubrā by Ibn Battah)

When it came to the Names and Attributes of Allāh the *Salaf* would say: ‘Let the narration pass (i.e. accept it) just as it has been narrated’ – as it will be mentioned later – and thus they became safe in their religion.

**3) The Prophet (ﷺ) and the *Salaf* would point towards the attribute as an affirmation of the real meaning of the Attribute while negating that it
should be metaphorical. And this prohibits that the Attribute can be interpreted according to *ijtihād*, opinion and analogy or claiming that they are metaphorical.**

This means that the Prophet (ﷺ) would point at the time of speaking at – for example – his ear or his eye, or indicate with his hand or finger
dependant upon which Attribute he (ﷺ) was describing, not by way of *tamthīl* (comparing) rather by way of affirming the Attribute and verifying it. And this occur many places in the *ahādīth* and narrations.

*"Alī ibn Nasr and Muhammad ibn Yūnus An-Nasāī Al-Ma’nā narrated to us and said: ‘Abdullāh ibn Yazīd Al-Muqrī narrated to us (and said): Harmalah (i.e. ibn ‘Imrān) narrated to us (and said): Abū Yūnus Sulaym ibn Jubayr the mawlā of Abū Hurayrah narrated to me and said: I heard Abū
Hurayrah recite this verse: **"Verily Allāh commands you to return trusts to their rightful owners."** Until His words: **"All-Hearing, All-Seeing."** (An-Nisā 4:58) He (Abū Hurayrah)
said: ‘I saw the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) put his thumb upon his ear and the (finger) that follows it upon his eye.’ Abū Hurayrah said: ‘I saw the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) recite it and put his two fingers.’ Ibn Yūnus said: Al-Muqrī said:
‘Verily Allāh is All-Hearing and All-Seeing means, that Allah has hearing and sight.’ Abū Dāwūd said: ‘And this is a refutation of the Jahmiyyah.’"* (Sunan Abū Dāwūd)

Ibn Mājah (d. 273h) narrated:

*"Hishām ibn ‘Ammār and Muhammad ibn As-Sabbāh narrated to us and said: ‘Abdul-‘Azīz ibn Abī Hāzim narrated to us (and said): Abū ‘Ubayd-Allāh ibn Miqsam narrated to me from
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say while he was standing upon the pulpit: **"Al-Jabbār will take His heavens and His earths in
His Hand"** – and he grasped with his hand and began to grasp and unfold it – **and then He will say: I am Al-Jabbār, I am the King. Where are the oppressors, where are the arrogant?"** He
said: And the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) was swaying from his right to his left until I saw the pulpit moving from below it until I said (to myself): Is it going to fall with the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ)?’"* (Sunan Ibn Mājah)

Imām Ahmad (d. 781h) said:

*"Abū Al-Muthannā Mu’ādh ibn Mu’ādh narrated to us, from Hammād ibn Salamah, from Thābit Al-Bunānī, from Anas ibn Mālik (رضي الله عنه) from the Prophet (ﷺ) regarding His – ‘azza wa jalla – words: **"So when his Lord appeared to the mountain
He made it collapse to dust."** (Al-A’rāf 7:143) He said: He (ﷺ) said: ***"Like this (i.e. he exposed the tip of the little finger)."*** My father said: ‚Mu’ādh showed us
how (with his little finger), so Humayd At-Tāwil said to him: ‘Why are you doing like that, O Abū Muhammad?’ He said: So he struck his chest with a hard strike and said: ‘Who are you O Humayd
and what are you O Humayd? Anas ibn Mālik narrated it to me from the Prophet (ﷺ) and you are saying: Why are you doing that?"* (Musnad Imām Ahmad)

Abdullāh ibn Ahmad (d. 290h) said:

*"I heard my father – (رحمه الله) – say: From Yahyā ibn Sa’īd the hadīth of Sufyān, from Al- A’mash, from Mansūr, from Ibrāhīm, from ’Ubaydah, from ’Abdullāh, from the Prophet (ﷺ): **"That Allāh will hold the heavens upon one Finger."** My father – (رحمه الله) – said: ‘Yahyā began to show with his fingers.’ And my father showed me how he
began to show with his fingers putting one finger upon another finger until he came to the last of them."* (Kitāb As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh)

So all these narrations show how the *Salaf* would affirm the real meaning of the Attribute which necessitates the impossibility of interpreting the Attributes according to something else than their actual meanings or explainging their condition without a proof.

Ad-Dārimī (d. 280h) said:

*"Regarding what you have mentioned of ijtihād regarding the condition of the Attributes of the Lord, then we verily do not allow ijtihād of opinion in many issues of the farāid (obligatory acts of
worship) and the judgments which we see with our eyes and hear with our ears. Then how (should we allow it) regarding the Attributes of the Lord which the eyes have not seen and the assumptions have been cut off from?"* (An-Naqd by Ad-Dārimī)

And Ibn Mandah (d. 395h) said:

*"And likewise we say regarding what has gone forth of these narrations regarding the Attributes in this book of ours; (that) we narrate them without tamthīl (giving examples), tashbīh (comparing),
takyīf (explaining), qiyās (analogy) and tawīl (interpretation), according to what the truthful Salaf conveyed from the pure Sahābah from Al-Mustafā (ﷺ). And we declare
as ignorant whoever speaks about them except with a clear proof from the Messenger (ﷺ) or a narration from a Sahābī who was present at (the time of) the revelation."* (Kitāb At-Tawhīd by Ibn Mandah)

## *Shirk* in Tawhīd *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt*

*Shirk* in Tawhid *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt* is making someone equal to Allāh – the Exalted – in anything from His Names and Attributes, or to describe Allāh with any of the attributes of
the creation. So whoever describes someone from the creation with any of Allāh Names and Attributes while believing that this created being or thing, holds the meaning of the
attribute which is specific for Allāh, then he is *mushrik* in *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt*. Such as the one who describes a person as being hearing while believing he can hear everything just
like Allāh hears everything, or that he can hear from a distance or under circumstances in which a normal human-bring cannot hear.

Some of the types of *shirk* that people perform, in this type of Tawhīd are the following:

* Deriving names for false deities from the Names of Allāh such as Al-Lāt from Al-Ilāh, and Al’Uzzā from Al-‘Azīz.
* The belief of some **Sūfiyyah** and **Rawāfid** that theirs *shuyūkh* and *awliyā* can hear their *du’ā* (invocation) no matter where they are.
* The belief of the *Mushabbihah* who compare the Creator with the creation. An example of this is:

Allāh – the Exalted – said: **”Rather His two Hands are wide outstretched. He spends however He wills.”** (Al-Māidah 5:64)

Then the **Mushabbih** says: ‚The Hands of Allāh are like the hands of the creation‛, and thereby they make Allāh equal to the creation in this Attribute of Allāh.

* The *manhaj* of the **Jahmiyyah** who rejected the Names and attributes of Allāh and distorted their meanings and thereby described Him – the Exalted – with deficiency and
  nothingness, while claiming to flee from comparing the Creator with the created. Included here are every sect who might go under a different name, but rejects and distorts the meanings of the Names and Attributes of Allāh.

Hammād ibn Zayd (d. 179h) said:

*"The example of the Jahmiyyah is like a man to whom it was said: ‘Is there a palm tree in your residence?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ It was said: ‘Does it have leaves?’ He said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does it
then have fronds?’ He said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does it then have a stem?’ He said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does it then have a trunk?’ He said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does it then have a root?’ He said: ‘No.’ It
was said: ‘Then there is no palm tree in your residence.’ It was said to these Jahmiyyah: ‘Do you have a lord?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ It was said: ‘Does he speak?’ They said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does he
have a hand?’ They said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does he then have a foot?’ They said: ‘No.’ Does he then have a finger?’ They said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does he become pleased or angry?’ They said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Then you do not have a lord.’"* (Sharh Madhāhib Ahlus-Sunnah by Ibn Shāhin)

Al-Bukhārī (d. 256h) said:

*"And some from the people of knowledge said: ’Verily the Jahmiyyah they are (in reality) the Mushabbihah [Those who compares the Creator with the creation]. Because they compared their Lord with the statues, the deaf and the mute which cannot hear, cannot see and cannot speak and cannot create."* (Khalq Af’āl Al-‘Ibād p. 111)

And Ad-Dārimī (d. 280h) said regarding the Jahmiyyah:

*"And we also declare takfīr upon them due to what is well-known of their kufr; that they do not establish (i.e. believe in) for Allāh – the Exalted – a Face, Hearing, Seeing, Knowledge, Speech nor
(any) attribute, except with the interpretation of misguided people who have been exposed and their mistakes have become clear. They say: ‘His Hearing, Seeing, Knowledge and Speech are with the
same meaning. And He Himself is everywhere, in every closed house and every locked box.’ Verily  did – according to their claim – its walls, its bars and its locks surround Him. So to Allāh we
declare ourselves free from an ilāh who has this description. And this is also a clear reason for declaring takfīr upon them."* (Ar-Rad ‘alā Al-Jahmiyyah by Ad-Dārimī p.182)

Ad-Dārimī (d. 280h) also said when speaking about Bishr Al-Marīsī who was one of the leaders of the Jahmiyyah:

*"And the strange thing from Al-Marisi – the owner of this madhhab – is that he claims (to believe in) the Tawhid of Allah with this madhhab and what is similar to it, while he verily invalidated all
the Attributes of Al-Wahid Al-Ahad. So he claimed according to the measurements of his madhhab that the one whom he worships as an ilah is limbless, imperfect, disfigured and incomplete and that
his Oneness is not fulfilled except through a created being, nor is he free of needing created things such as speech, knowledge and name. Woe to you, verily the truthful muwahhid in his Tawhid is
the one who unifies Allah in His Perfection and in all of His Attributes, in His knowledge, His speech, His grasp, His outstretch (of Hands), His descent, His ascension; the One who is in no need
of His creation in all of His Attributes among the Being, the Face, the Hearing, the Seeing, the two Hands, the Knowledge, the Speech, the Capability, the Mashīah, the Authority, the Withholder, the
Extender, the Bestower of honor, the Humiliator, the Living, the Subsisting and the One who does whatever He wants. This person is closer to Tawhid than this person who unifies a limbless,
imperfect and incomplete god; if he were a slave with this description then he would not have been worth two dates. So how can someone similar to it be the god of all the worlds? Exalted is Allah far above this description."* (Naqd Ad-Dārimī)
## Other nullifiers which have not been mentioned

There are a few nullifier of Islām which has not yet been mentioned. These are:

* Al-Istihzā (mocking) and As-Sabb (cursing). This includes mocking, belittling or cursing at anything from the religion of Islām.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And if you asked them, they will verily say: ‘We were only conversing and playing.’ Say: ‘Is it Allāh, His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking? Do not come with excuses, you have verily committed *kufr* after your īmān.”** (At-Tawbah 9:65-66)

And He – the Exalted said:

**“And when he knows something of Our verses he makes fun of it. For those there is a humiliating punishment.”** (Al-Jāthiyah 45:9)

Ishāq ibn Rāhūyah (d. 77<h) said:

*"The Muslims have agreed upon that the one who curses at Allāh, or curses at His Messenger (ﷺ), or denies anything from what Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – has revealed, or kills a prophet among the prophets of Allāh, that he is kāfir by doing that, even if he acknowledges everything which Allāh has revealed."* (At-Tamhīd by Ibn ‘Abdul-Barr)

* *As-Sihr* (black magic), which is the agreement between a magician and a *shaytān* (a devil among the *jinn*), that the magician will perform some acts of worship for the *shaytān* who in return will help him or obey him in what he demands from him.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And they followed what the *shayātīn* recited in the reign of Sulaymān. And Sulaymān did not disbelieve, rather the *shayātīn* disbelieved. They taught the people magic and what was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Hārūt and Mārūt.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:102)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

*"He is not from us the one who gives omens or has omens done for him, or he foretells or someone foretells for him, or he performs magic or magic is performed for him. And whoever goes to a
foreteller and believes in what he says, then he has committed kufr in what was revealed to Muhammad (ﷺ)."* (Al-Bazzār – with a good isnād)

In order to achieve the cooperation of the *shaytān* the magician has to perform deed such as asking the *shayātīn* for help, invoking them in things which they are not capable of, utter
words of *kufr* in order to please them, slaughter for them, or mock some of things which Allāh has ordered to venerate such as the Qurān and other things, all of which is clear *kufr*
from the one performing it. Add to these things if the one doing it or has it done for him believes that the *shayātīn* can benefit or harm without the permission of Allah or that they know the unseen.

So whoever performs magic according to what is described above, or has magic performed for him or is pleased with any of what has been mentioned, then he is *kāfir* according to what has already gone forth of evidences and principles of the religion.

* *Al-I’rād* (turning away), which is the *kufr* that consist of turning away from learning the religion and performing what it necessitates and requires of the slave.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”And those who disbelieve turn away from what they were warned against.”** (Al-Ahqāf 46:3)

At-Tabarī (d. 310h) said in his *tafsīr* of the verse:

*"And His words: **"And those who disbelieve turn away from what they were warned against."** He – Exalted is His mention – says: ‘And those who rejected the Oneness of Allāh are
turning away from the warning of Allāh to them. They do not take a warning, nor do they think, nor do they take a lesson."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“So he did not believe nor did he pray. Rather he rejected and he turned away.”** (Al-Qiyāmah 75:31-32)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"By the One whose Hand Muhammad’s soul is in, no-one from this Ummah, neither a Jew nor a Christian hears about me, and then do not believe in what I have been sent with, except that he is from the people of the fire."*** (Sahīh Muslim)

Everyone today who does not know the fundamental principles of Islām, nor does he perform the obligatory acts of worship due to not having sought to learn it, then he is not considered to be ignorant because the knowledge is present and accessible, rather he is considered to be among those who turned away from learning the religion of Allah, which is *kufr*.


## The second testimony: *Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh*

The testimony of ***Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh*** includes the belief in the Prophethood of Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib ibn Hāshim ibn ‘Abdi-Manāf ibn Qusayy
ibn Kilāb ibn Murrah ibn Ka’b ibn Luay ibn Ghālib ibn Fihr ibn Mālik ibn An-Nadr ibn Kinānah ibn Khuzaymah ibn Mudrikah ibn Ilyās ibn Mudar ibn Nazār ibn Ma’ad ibn
‘Adnān, and ‘Adnān is among the children of Ismā’īl ibn Ibrāhīm (عليه السلام), and that he (ﷺ) is the Messenger of Allāh. This includes:

1. The general belief in his (ﷺ) Message to all created beings, both jinn and mankind.
2. The belief in that he (ﷺ) is the last messenger and that his Message is the seal of all the messages.
3. The belief in that his (ﷺ) Message abrogates all previous messages and legislations.
4. The belief in that he (ﷺ) conveyed the Message in its entirety, he fulfilled the amānah (trust), he gave advice to his Ummah until he left it on a clear path whose night is like its day.
5. The belief in that he (ﷺ) is protected in what he conveys from Allāh the Exalted.
6. The belief in what he (ﷺ) deserves of rights, such as loving him, respecting him, honoring him and holding him at high esteem.
7. The belief that he (ﷺ) is dead and buried in Madīnah.

The testimony of ***Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh*** furthermore includes believing in everything which he (ﷺ) informed about, and the obedience of him in what he ordered. This is because whatever the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) has informed about, regarding Allāh, His religion or the unseen, then this is revelation from Allāh the Exalted, based upon His – the Exalted – words:

**“By the star when it descends. Your companion** (i.e. Muhammad) **has not gone astray nor has he erred. And he does not speak from** (his own) **desire. Rather it is revelation being revealed.”** (An-Najm 53:1-4)

So whatever he (ﷺ) has informed about and established, then it is obligatory to establish it and believe in it, and whatever he negated, then it is obligatory to  negate it. Thus it is obligatory for the believers to establish and believe in everything
which the Messenger of Allāh informed about, regarding the Names and Attributes of Allāh. Likewise they must negate for Him whatever he negated for Allāh, such as
similarity with the created being, and in this way they become free from ta’tīl (invalidating), *takyīf* (explaining), *tashbīh* (comparing) and *tahrīf* (distorting).

Furthermore there is no legislation, except the legislation which the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) came with. Thus, accepting another legislation than the Sharī’ah is a breach of both the testimony of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* and the testimony of *Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh*. Allāh – the Exalted – says:

**“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you** (O Muhammad) **judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept** (them) **with full submission.”** (An-Nisā 4:65)

So the true believers believe in the Messenger (ﷺ) in what he has informed about Allāh, the Last Day, Islām, Īmān and Ihsān, and they obey him (ﷺ) in what he has ordered and forbidden, they consider allowed what he
has allowed and consider forbidden what he has forbidden, and they adopt the true religion based upon the Qurān and the *Sunnah*. Because there is no good except that the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) has ordered it and no evil except that he forbade it.

The ahādīth of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) are referred to as the *Sunnah*. In the *Sunnah* issues from both the *usūl* (fundamental principles) of the religion and the *furū’* (branches) of the religion can be found. And no-one is saved from *bida’* (innovation) except the person who bases his religion upon the Qurān and the *Sunnah*.

After the death of the Messenger (ﷺ), the groups of innovation such as the Khawārij, the Qadariyyah, the Murjiah, the Rāfidah, the Jahmiyyah and the Mu’tazilah emerged, and the people of truth became distinguished by a name indicating
that they remained upon what the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) came with; this name was ***Ahlul-Hadīth*** (the people of *hadīth*) or ***Ahlus-Sunnah***. And the responsibility of aligning ones belief with the *understanding* of the *Salaf* is an individual obligation which no-one is free from adhering to.
## The nullifiers of *Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh*

Among that which nullifies and invalidates the testimony of *Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh* are the following:

* Cursing him, swearing at him, belittling him and mocking him (ﷺ). Included in this is speaking about him (ﷺ) in a negative
  way, such as saying: "He was busy with women" or "I don’t know if he was sane or insane" or other similar statements that has a negative connotation or mentioning some
  negative words in which the Prophet (ﷺ) is intended without mentioning his (ﷺ) name or title directly.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”And among them are those who harm the Prophet and they say he is *udhun*** (a person who believes everything he hears)**. Say: ‘**(He is) **a good *udhun* for you. He believes in Allāh
and believes the believers and** (he is) **a mercy to those who believe among them.’ And those who harm the Messenger of Allāh will have a painful punishment.”** (At-Tawbah 9:62)

At-Tabarī (d. 310) mentioned in his *tafsīr* of the verse:

*"Ibn Humayd narrated to us and said: Salamah narrated to us from Ibn Ishāq who said: ‘Allāh mentioned their betrayal – i.e. the munafiqūn – and their harm towards the Prophet (ﷺ) when He said: **"And among them are those who harm the Prophet and
they say he is *udhun* (a person who believes everything he hears)."** Until the rest of the verse. And the one said these words, according to what has reached me was Nabtal ibn Al-Hārith
the brother of Banū ‘Amr ibn ‘Awf, and regarding him the verse was revealed. And this was because he said: ‘Verily Muhammad is udhun (an ear). Whoever narrates something to him then he
believes in him.’ Allah says: **"Say: ‘(He is) a good *udhun* for you."** This means: He hears what is good and believes in it."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

Another thing which is included in mocking the Prophet (ﷺ) – and this is applicable for all of the prophets of Allāh (عليه السلام) – is playing, acting and
portraying him (or them) in tv-movies and series. This is from the angle of belittling him. Because when an actor tries to portray any of the prophets he decreases them to his own lowly state while they (عليه السلام) are free from that.

The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Do not swear at my companions. Do not swear at my companions. Because by the One in whose Hand my soul is in, if one of you spent an amount of gold at the size of (the mountain of) Uhud, he would still not reach the weight (i.e. worth) of any of them, and not even the half of it."*** (Sahīh Muslim)

If this is the comparison between the *Sahābah* and normal people, then how about someone portraying to be a prophet of Allāh, and then after that he goes and plays another role as a
criminal or a homosexual or a sinner, or he returns to his own persona which might be a sinning corrupt *kāfir* who has no right of being compared in any way with any of the
prophets of Allāh (عليه السلام). This is the exact opposite of respecting them, honoring them and venerating them.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”So those who believe and honored him** (i.e. Muhammad) **and gave support to him and followed the Light which was revealed with him, these are the successful.”** (Al-A’rāf 7:157)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”In order for you to believe in Allāh and His Messenger, and honor him and respect him** (i.e. the Messenger)**, and praise Him** (i.e. Allāh) **in the morning and afternoon.”** (Al-Fath 48:9)

So the Prophet (ﷺ) is not like any man in history which can be portrayed in movies or series, nor are his words like the words of others that can be accepted or rejected as a person wish. Rather he is the Messenger and Prophet of Allāh (ﷺ) and is not to be treated like an ordinary man.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“Do not make (your) calling of the Messenger among you as the way you call each other.”** (24:63)

Mujāhid (d. after 104h) said regarding this verse:

*"He ordered them to call him (by saying): ‘O Messenger of Allāh’, in softness and humility, and that they should not say: ‘O Muhammad’, while frowning."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

And Qatādah (d. 118h) said:

*"He ordered them to venerate him and hold him in high esteem (or honor)."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

Allāh has blessed the prophets in everything, from their bodies to their manners and their knowledge. So it is not possible for anyone – whether this is said while joking, being
serious or acting – to say: ‘I am this or this prophet’, without him due to his faulty nature and low status compared to them, is belittling the prophet.

* Following a prophet or messenger after him, such as Musaylamah Al-Kadhdhāb, Al-Aswad Al-’Ansī or Ghulām Ahmad. Or accepting a legislation other than his legislation,
  either an abrogated legislation, or a newly invented legislation. Or that he claims that he or anyone else is exempt from following the legislation of Muhammad (ﷺ).

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you** (O Muhammad) **judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept** (them) **with full submission.”** (An-Nisā 4:65)

* Believing that he (ﷺ) is not dead, or that he possesses aspects of divinity through which he can have affect upon the affairs from his grave, such as knowing the unseen, that he can benefit or harm, or that he hears and answers invocations.

Allah – the Exalted – said:

**”You will verily die, and they will verily** (also) **die.”** (Az-Zumar 39:30)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”And Muhammad is nothing more than a messenger. Verily have the messengers before him passed away. Then if he dies or is killed will you then turn back on your heels? And whoever turns back on his heels he does not harm Allah at all. And Allah will reward the grateful.”** (Āli ‘Imrān 3:144)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Do not praise me with more than I am like the Christians praised the Son of Maryam with more than he was. I am verily His slave, so say: the slave of Allāh and His Messenger."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

## The *Sunnah* and its rules

The term ***Sunnah*** covers over all issues in the religion which evidence have come in the *hadīth* of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ). As for this book, then it is
confined to issues of *‘aqīdah*. Nevertheless the rules of the *Sunnah* are general for all issues, and it is the correct way of dealing with the hadīth from the Prophet (ﷺ). As for these rules then they are:

* **The Sunnah is the *tafsīr* (interpretation) of the Qurān.**

In order to remain upon *Sunnah* in the *‘aqīdah* and protect one’s self from *bida’* (innovation, which is the opposite of *Sunnah*) a person must interpret the Qurān with the *Sunnah*. The
reason for this being mentioned is, that most of the people of innovation took verses from the Qurān and interpreted it in their own way while ignoring the correct *ahādīth* which
was narrated on the subject, and by this they fell in innovation in their beliefs. [Examples of this will be given later in this book.]

Qatādah (d. 118h) said:

*"I said to the Mother of the believers (‘Āishah): ‘Inform me about the manners (or behaviour) of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ).’ She said: ‘Do you not read the Qurān?’ I said: ‘Yes.’ She said: ‘Verily the manners of the Prophet (ﷺ) were the Qurān."* (Sahīh Muslim)

* **To adhere to what the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) were upon (رضي الله عنهم).**

This is because they are those who understood him (ﷺ) best. So whoever wants to know how a *hadīth* should be understood and applied, then he should
go to the sayings of the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) and their students from the *tābi’ūn,* as this previously have been explained in the opening of this book. The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Verily, whoever among you that will live after me will verily see a lot of disagreement. So it is (obligatory) upon you to follow my Sunnah, and the Sunnah of the righteous and
guided caliphs. Bite it with your molar teeth (i.e. grasp firmly onto it and don’t let go). And be aware of every newly invented matter. Because every bid’ah (innovation) is
misguidance."*** (At-Tirmidhī, Ibn Mājah, Abū Dāwūd and Imām Ahmad with a small difference – *thābit sahīh*)

* **Leaving any opinion which opposes or contradicts the hadīth.**

Anything which opposes or contradicts the meaning of a *hadīth* is an innovation. From the rights of the Messenger of Allāh, is to believe in him (ﷺ) and
believe in that he perfectly conveyed his Message in its entirety and that he did not leave anything unclear. Therefore whoever follows something which does not originate from the
Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) then he is following innovations, lusts and desires. And this necessitates the claim the The Prophet (ﷺ) has betrayed this Ummah, by not informing them about something from the religion.

Imām Mālik (d. 179h) said:

‛Whoever invents anything in this Ummah which our Salaf (predecessors) was not upon, then he
has verily claimed that the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) has betrayed the religion. Because Allāh says: **"Today I have fulfilled for you your religion."** (Al-Māidah 9:7)
So whatever was not from the religion at that time will never be from the religion today."* (Kitāb Al-I’tisām by Ash-Shātibī)

* **There is no *qiyās* (analogy) in the *Sunnah*, nor are similitudes (or examples) put forth with it. The opinion or that which the intellect or desires leans towards are not taken into consideration when it comes to accepting the *Sunnah*. Rather it is solely to be followed and desires are left in it.**

The *hadīth* is an undisputed source of legislation in the religion of Islām. One cannot, nor has the right to come with an example or an analogy from his opinion that renders the meaning of the *hadīth* invalid or inapplicable. The same way the *Sharī’ah* is not put up to a
democratic voting for the people to chose it (because it is obligatory whether the people want it or not), then the *Sunnah* is not up for measuring or evaluation by anyone, whoever
this might be. That which the *hadīth* states according to how the *Salaf* understood and applied it, is the only correct way of understanding and applying the *hadīth,* and that which opposes this is innovation and misguidance.

* **Leaving the people of innovation and discussing with them about the beliefs, and in general leaving discussion, arguments and disputes in the religion.**

The *Salaf* would consider it from the principles of the *Sunnah* itself that a person would leave discussion and arguing in the religion, even if the person himself is upon the right
path. This is once again due to the fact that no-one from the people of *Sunnah* and *Jamā’ah* have ever debated, argued or discussed regarding the *Sunnah*. Rather all of them – from
the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) and until the end of what was of scholars of the *Salaf* – have submitted to the meaning of the *hadīth* without debating, arguing and discussing, all
while following the above mentioned principles. This religion is based upon submission – thus the name Al-Islām (Submission) – and therefore contradicting this by indulging in
discussions and arguing is an innovation not performed by the *Salaf.* Furthermore opening the door to discussing and debating the meaning of the *ahādīth* only opens the door to
misguidance and mistakes, while submitting and remaining quiet is the way of staying safe.

Imām Ahmad (d. 241h) said:

*"The fundamental principles of Sunnah for us are: Adhering to that which the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) were upon. And (it is) leaving innovations. And
every innovation is misguidance. And leaving (both) the disputes (with the people of desires) and sitting with the people of desires (i.e. innovation). And leaving arguing, discussing and disputes in
the religion."* (Usūl As-Sunnah by Imām Ahmad – the *riwāyah* of ‘Abdūs)

## That which opposes the *Sunnah*

Everything which opposes the *Sunnah* is a bid’ah (innovation). The only disagreement in the religion which is allowed is that in which the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) disagreed in.
It is not allowed for anyone to come with an opinion or a verdict in the religion which oppose that which has been narrated in the *hadīth* and oppose the opinion regarding it narrated from the *Salaf.*

So everyone who falls in this mistake have fallen in innovation whether he likes it or not. The innovation in the religion is of two types:

* **The first: *Al-Bid’ah Al-Mukaffirah,* which is the innovation which reaches the level of *kufr* and brings the person committing it or believing in it out of the fold of Islām.**

Every *shirk* is a ***bid’ah mukaffirah*** which has not been legislated in the Qurān and *Sunnah.* So whoever claims that his *shirk* is from the religion, such as taking the people in the
graves as intermediary between themselves and Allāh, then he has left the religion. Another example of a *bid’ah mukaffirah* could be the innovation of those who claimed that
the Qurān is created, due to what this contains of rejecting the Attributes of Allāh, and the conclusion that the Attributes of Allāh – and thereby also Allāh – are created. Or those
who claim that the slaves create their own deeds without the pre-existing knowledge of Allāh, and thereby ascribing a rival and partner with Allāh in the creation. Anyone who performs or believes in a *bid’ah mukaffirah* is *kāfir.*

* **The second: *Al-Bid’ah ghayr Al-Mukaffirah*, which means the innovation which does not reach the level of *kufr* and thus does not bring the person committing it out of the fold of Islām.**

Every way of worshipping or believing in Allāh which is not according to the Qurān and *Sunnah,* but it does not reach the limit of being a *nāqid* (nullifier) of Islām, is a *bid’ah ghayr
mukaffirah.* Whoever performs or believes in such a thing is an innovator who must be avoided until he returns to the truth. Examples of this could be those saying the *niyyah*
(intention) for prayer out loud, or taking the birthday of the Prophet (ﷺ) as a day of celebration, or making a specific amount of *dhikr* in specific place and
times which are not prescribed in the *Sunnah* and making *dhikr* in congregation, all which have no basis in the Islāmic legislation etc. All these deeds are evil, but the one performing it does not become a *kāfir* merely by doing this.

And following are some of the tools which the innovators use to justify their innovation.

## The methodologies of innovation

The innovators have many methods by which they reach to their *bid’ah.* The names might differ but the result is the same; namely leaving the narrations from the Messenger of
Allāh (ﷺ), the narrations from his Companions (رضي الله عنهم) and the scholars who followed them in goodness. Below are some of these methods that all necessitate leaving the *Sunnah.*

* ***Raī* (opinion)**

The criticized *raī* (opinion) in Islām is that which opposes the *Sunnah* and have no basis in the Qurān or the *Sunnah.* Rather it is based upon personal opinion, lust and desires while it at the same time opposes the meaning which has come in the Qurān and *Sunnah*.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**"O you who believe. Do not prioritize anything over Allāh and His Messenger. And fear Allāh. Verily Allāh is All-Hearing and All-Knowing.”** (Al-Hujurat 49:1)

And the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) said:

***"Verily Allāh does not take away knowledge after having given it to you, by snatching it away (suddenly). Rather He takes it away from them by taking away the scholars and
their knowledge. Then ignorant people will remain, who will be asked to give fatwā and so they will give fatwā with their own opinions, so they misguide and they are misguided."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)


And ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattāb (رضي الله عنه) said:

*"Verily the people of raī (opinion) are the enemies of the Sunan (pl. Sunnah). They were not able to memorize it, and understanding it also escaped them, and they were shy to say: ‘I don’t know’,
when they were asked. So they opposed the Sunan with their opinions. So beware of them."* (Jāmi’Bayān Al-‘Ilm by Ibn ‘Abdul-Barr, and I’lām Al-Muwaqqi’īn by Ibn Al-Qaayim – the *isnād* is on the utmost level of correctness)

So every opinion – no matter who produced it or spoke well of it – which opposes the meaning found in the *hadīth,* then it is innovation and misguidance. And this opinion could be based upon the following, which all consists of leaving the narration of the *Salaf*:

* ***Qiyās* (analogy)**

The **criticized *qiyās*** in Islām is the one which is performed with the existence of evidence on the issue. The *qiyās* which results in something which opposes what the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) has said or done is rejected and not taken into consideration at all.

Imam Ahmad (d. 241h) said:

*"And there is no qiyās (analogy) in the Sunnah, nor are similitudes (or examples) put forth with it. Nor is it comprehended through the intellect nor the desires. Rather it is (solely) to be followed and leaving desires in it."* (Usul As-Sunnah, the riwayah of ‘Abdus)

Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And know – may Allah have mercy upon you – that in the Sunnah there is no qiyās (analogy), nor are similitudes (or examples) put forth with it, nor are desires followed in it. Rather it is the belief in
the narrations of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), without conditioning or explaining, nor is it asked ‘why’ or ‘how’. So speaking, disputing, discussing and arguing are newly invented matter which cast doubt in the heart, even if the one who does is correct upon the truth and the Sunnah."* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)

* ***Ijtihād* (exertion)**

The rejected *ijtihād* which in no way is acceptable is the one which is performed with the existence of evidence on the issue. The *ijtihād* which results in something which opposes
what the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) has said or done is rejected, is not taken into consideration, and the one performing it will not be rewarded for that, rather he will lift the burden for it and for everyone who followed him in his innovation.

* ***Falsafah* (philosophy), *hawā* (desires) and *‘ilm al-kalām***

Philosphy and desires have no place in Islām. The evidences are there to be submitted to and believed in. If a person’s *nafs* (soul) feels unease or has difficulties accepting the
meaning which is narrated in the *hadīth,* then it is still obligatory for him to accept the narration and its meaning just as it has been narrated. As for the **Mutakallimūn** (followers
of *‘ilm al-kalām*) then they – based upon Greek philosophy – established some laws for which Allāh did not sent down any authority, which they used to determine what from
the Islamic sources could be accepted, rejected or perhaps had to be interpreted in order to be within the borders of their laws. Thus their laws became a *tāghūt* for them which they sought *tahākum* with and worshipped.

Imām Ahmad (d. 241 h) said:

*"It is upon you (to follow) the Sunnah, the hadīth and that through which Allah benefits you. And be aware of engaging (in discussions), disputing and arguing. Because verily the one who loves the
kalām (words that have no basis in the Qurān and Sunnah) and everyone who invents some kalām then his affairs in the end will be nothing but innovation, because the kalām does not invite to goodness."* (Al-Ibānah by Ibn Battah)

And Imām Ash-Shāfi’ī (d. 204h) said:

*"My hukm (verdict) upon the people of kalām is that they are hit with palm-branches and circulated through the tribes while it is called out regarding them: ‘This is the punishment for the one who leaves the Book and the Sunnah and turns to kalām.’"* (Siyar A’lām An-Nubalā by Adh-Dhahabī)

* ***Tawīl bātil* (false interpreation)**

Interpreting the evidences in a wrong way is also not accepted in Islām. The Qurān and the *Sunnah* must be understood as the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) and their students
understood them. So whoever brings an interpretation of the evidences of Islām which is not in accordance with the understanding of the *Salaf*, then this is an innovation and misguidance.

Ibn Mandah (d. 295h):

*"The tawīl (false interpretation) for people of hadīth is a type of rejection."* (Ar-Radd ‘alā Al-Jahmiyyah by Ibn Mandah)

## The *Usūl* of the *Sunnah*

The scholars from the Salaf mentioned some issues from ‘aqīdah that have their basis in the
Sunnah, and they referred to these issues as the Usūl (fundamental principles) of the
Sunnah. Among the Salaf of this Ummah no-one would be considered a Sunnī (follower of
the Sunnah) until he fulfilled and believed in all of these principles. Thus, every sect that
opposed any of these principles – even if it was only one – was given a name to
differentiate them from the people of truth.

Basically all innovations that exist today have their basis in the same types of misguided
innovations which were mentioned by the Salaf in their books regarding the Sunnah. Only
today they have become more extreme and more severe in their opposition to the Islāmic
texts. But whatever of misguided innovative beliefs and principles that have survived
from the time of the Salaf until today – and some people mentions these issues in their
books as if they are an acceptable manhaj – then they are still misguided innovative beliefs
which must be avoided before a person can call himself a follower of the *Sunnah.*

The truth is not known through men, rather the truth is known through the narrations.

Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And beware of the small innovations, because the small of innovations return until they become big. And every bid’ah which was innovated in this Ummah began like this as something small that
looked like the truth, so the one who entered it was deceived by that. Then he was not able to exit from it, and it grew and became a religion which he adopted. So he opposed the Straight Path and
exited from Islām. So beware – may Allāh have mercy upon you – of everyone whose words you listen to specifically from the people of your time. Do not hasten and do not believe in anything
until you ask and look; did anyone from the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) speak about this or anyone from the scholars (of the Salaf)? Then if you find an athar
(narration) regarding it from them, then hold on to it and do not deviate from it for anything, and do not chose anything over it, so you (if you do that) would fall in the fire"* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)

So the salvation lies in following the narrations.

An important thing to be aware of is – as it has already been mentioned – that the *Salaf*
would not consider a person as a follower of the *Sunnah* until he believed in and adapted
as his religion all the *usūl* of the *Sunnah*. Therefore it is important for the Muslim to study
the books of the *Salaf* and learn the fundamental principles of the *Sunnah* in order to be
free from innovation, just as he learns the fundamental principles of Tawhīd in order to be
free from shirk.

Imām Ahmad (d. 241h) said:

*"And from the obligatory Sunnah, where the one who leaves one of them – by not accepting it and believing in it – then he is not from its people is..."* (Usūl As-Sunnah by Imām Ahmad – the *riwāyah* of ‘Abdūs)

And then he went on to mention some of the principles of the *Sunnah*.

And Sufyān ibn ‘Uyaynah (d. 198h) said:

*"The Sunnah is ten. So whoever has these then he has completed the Sunnah, and whoever leaves any of it, then he has left the Sunnah."* (Sharh Usūl I’tiqād Ahlu Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah by Al- Lālakāī)

Harb ibn Ismā’īl Al-Karmānī (d. 280h) said:

*"So whoever opposed anything from these madhāhib (i.e. ways or beliefs) or speak evil of it, or criticizes the one who says it, then he is a mukhālif (opposer) mubtadi’ (innovator), (and he has) left the Jamā’ah and parted with the manhaj of Sunnah and the path of the Truth."* (Kitāb As-Sunnah by Al-Karmānī)

And Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And it is not allowed for a man to say that fulān is a follower of Sunnah until he knows that the characteristics of Sunnah are gathered with him. So he is not called a follower of Sunnah until all of the Sunnah is gathered with him."* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)

Following is an introduction to some of the *Usūl* (principles) of the *Sunnah* and some of the fundamental beliefs which the scholars have mentioned in their books, but not all. The
slave is encouraged to study the books of the *Salaf* [At the end of this book is a list of recommended books for the seeker of knowledge to study] in order to become acquainted with the
correct *’aqīdah* and the religious principles of the *Salaf* in general, but also to achieve the love of the people whom Allāh – from above the seventh heaven – chose to preserve His religion.

The reader is advised to notice how easy the religion becomes once the slave submits to the evidences. Just as the purpose and meaning of Tawhīd is very simple; worship Allah
and do not associate partners with Him in anything, then the purpose of the *Sunnah* is equally simple and easy to understand; submit to and believe in what have been narrated
in the *ahādīth* and *āthār* (narrations), and do not deviate from it for anything.

## Tawhīd and the description of Allāh

The *Salaf* mentioned the Tawhīd of Allāh and the description of Allāh and His Names and Attributes in their books of *Sunnah* due to the fact that the *hadīth* of the Messenger of Allāh
is the way of interpreting the Qurān. So whoever wants to believe in Allāh and understand the Qurān in the correct way, he has to follow the *Sunnah* in its explanation. So
whoever deviated (and deviates today) in the Tawhīd of *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt* (Names and Attributes) among the deviated sects, then the reason was (and is) their lack of believing in
and following the correct *tafsīr* (interpretation) of the Qurān, which is the Sunnah.

And whoever looks into the *Sunnah* with regards to the description of Allāh and His Names and Attributes will find that the key to correct understanding and belief is the
submittance to the words of Allāh and the words of His Messenger (ﷺ) just as they have been narrated without changing even one letter for one reason or
another. Thus it became a principle among the people of *Sunnah* that they believe in the description of Allāh – the Exalted – as this was narrated in the Qurān, from the Prophet (ﷺ), from the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) and those who followed
them in goodness, without:

- ***Tahrīf*** (distortion) – this means to change the meaning of the words to something else, such as the meaning of hand to meaning power.
- ***Ta’tīl*** (invalidation) – this means to reject and invalidate the meaning of the words, such as saying Allāh does not speak.
- ***Tashbīh*** (comparison) – this means to compare the Creator with the created, such as saying the Sight of Allāh is like the sight of the creation.
- ***Takyīf*** (conditioning) – this means to explain the conditions of the Name or Attribute, such as explaining how Allāh descends to the lowest heaven.
- ***Tafwīd*** (relegation) – this means establishing the words themselves, such as Hand, Face, Shin etc. but then claiming that the meaning of it is unknown, and thus not
  believing in the literal meaning of the Attribute.

The manhaj of the *Salaf* is summarized in the following words:

Al-Walīd ibn Muslim (d. 1 =9 h) said:

*"I asked Sufyān Ath-Thawrī, Mālik ibn Anas, Al-Awzā’ī and Layth ibn Sa’d about these ahādīth regarding the ruyah (seeing Allāh) and the Attributes (of Allāh). So they said: ‘Let them pass (i.e. accept them) as they have been narrated and do not interpret them.’"* (Mu’jam ibn Al-Muqrī p. 111)

And Ahmad ibn Nasr (d. 231h) said:

*"I asked Sufyān ibn ’Uyaynah saying: ‘O Abū Muhammad, I want to ask you something.’ So he said: ‘Do not ask.’ I said: ‘If I should not ask you, then who should I ask?’ He said: ‘(Then) ask.’ I
said: ‘What do you say about these ahādīth which were narrated regarding: The hearts are between Two Fingers, and that Allāh Laughs or is Amazed by the one who mentions Him in the markets?’
So he said: ‘Let them pass (i.e. accept them) just as they were narrated, without (describing) how.’"* (Marāsil Abū Dāwūd p. 182 As-Siyar 8/467 and others)

And Abū Bakr Al-Marrūdhī (d. 275h) said:

*"I asked Abū ‘Abdullāh (i.e. Imām Ahmad) about the ahādīth which the Jahmiyyah reject regarding the Attributes (of Allāh), the ruyah, the Isrā (night journey) and the story of the Throne. So Abū
‘Abdullāh described them as being correct, and he said: ‘Verily did the scholars receive these with acceptance. We submit to the reports just as they were narrated.’"* (As-Sunnah by Abū Bakr Al- Khallāl, Ash-Sharī’ah by Al-Ājurrī and Tabaqāt Al-Hanābilah)

And Abū ‘Īsā At-Tirmidhī (d. 279h) said:

*"Such was it narrated from Mālik, Sufyān ibn ‘Uyaynah and ‘Abdullāh ibn Al-Mubārak that they said regarding these ahādīth: ‘Let them pass (i.e. accept them) without (describing) how.’ And this
is the opinion of the people of knowledge from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah. But the Jahmiyyah rejected these narrations and they said: ‘This is comparing (the Creator with the creation).’ And
Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – has verily mentioned many places in His Book: the Hand, the Sight and the  Hearing. So the Jahmiyyah interpreted these verses, and they explained them differently than what
the people of knowledge have explained them. And they said: ‘Allāh has not created Ādam with His  Hand.’ And they said: ‘Verily the meaning of the Hand here is the Power.’"* (Al-Jāmi’ Al-Kabīr by At-Tirmidhī 2/42-43)

* The **Jahmiyyah** rejected the Names and Attributes of Allāh, under the argument that they necessitated *tashbih* (comparison) of the Creator with the creation. And by this
  rejection they are *kuffār*. Due to this belief they were also called the **Mu’attilah**, which means: those who invalidate (the Attributes of Allāh). The **Mu’tazilah** also rejected the
  Attributes. The **Matūrīdiyyah** and the **‘Ashā’irah** also made a form of ta’tīl when they invalidated the reality of Allāh’s Speech and claimed that the *Kalām* (Speech) of Allāh is
  internal speech which is without voice or letters. Rather what is heard of recitation of the Qurān, then according to their claim this is merely an expression of the Word of Allāh, but
  not the Qurān itself. With this description of the *Kalām* of Allāh they continued from ta’tīl into *tahrīf* by distorting the meaning of Attribute.

Many sects today, such as the ‘Ashā’irah, the Ahbāsh and other hold the same beliefs as the Jahmiyyah when it comes to the Names and Attributes of Allāh, even though they
might go under a different name. So whoever rejects any of the Names and Attributes of Allāh, then he is a *jahmi* in his beliefs whether he acknowledges this or not.

* The **Mushabbihah** compared the Names and Attributes of Allāh with those of the creation. So they said: ‘My sight is like the Sight of Allāh’, or ‘My hand is like the Hand of
  Allāh’, or ‘My foot is like the foot of Allāh’. This constitutes *takyīf* (conditioning) from the aspect that that described how the Attributes of Allāh are, and it constitutes *tashbīh*
  (comparison) from the aspect that they compared the Attributes of Allāh with the attributes of the creation. And by this comparison they have ascribed partners to Allāh in
  His Attributes, and they are *kuffār*.

* Many different sects and persons have indulged in *tahrīf* (distortion) of some of the Name and Attributes of Allāh. The **Jahmiyyah** said that *istawā* (rose above) the Throne in
  reality means *istawlā* (having authority or possession over) the Throne. Some claim that the *Rahmah* (Mercy) of Allāh means wanting to bless, while the *Ghadab* (Anger) of Allāh

means wanting to punish, while fleeing from the literal meanings of the two words. All of this is *tahrīf* (distortion) of the literal meanings and this is *bātil* (falsehood). Rather the
people of *Sunnah* believe that Allāh rose above His Throne, He has Mercy and Anger, and they do not describe the condition of these things, nor do they ask how.

* Another evil opinion claimed by the **Mufawwidah** was, that the words themselves of the Names and Attributes were to be established and believed in, but the meaning of them is
  unknown and the knowledge of it is only known by Allāh. For example would they accept and believe in the word *Yad* (Hand) made up by the letters *yā* and *dāl*, but they would
  claim having no idea what that word means. They claimed to follow the *Salaf* in this belief – which is false – but in reality they invented an hideous lie against Allāh and His
  Messenger (ﷺ) when claiming that such a big part of the religion – namely the Names and Attributes of Allāh – was left unexplained to the slaves.

The scholars have written books and books describing the false and innovative beliefs of the deviators, and they have given them all a name in order for them to be recognized and
warned against. Studying the right *‘aqīdah* goes hand in hand with studying the misguidance and innovation. The Muslim is obliged to submit to the evidences of the
Qurān and the *Sunnah*, according to the understanding and *manhaj* of the *Salaf*, because these issues are issues of *īmān* and *kufr*. So whoever denies an issue from the Tawhīd of
Allāh and His Names and Attriubutes, and the issue is known from the *fitrah*, then he is a *kāfir* and he will remain in Hellfire for ever if he dies upon that. This is because rejecting
anything from the Names and Attributes of Allāh from these kinds of issues, generally entails describing Him – the Exalted – with some form of deficiency, such as the one who
claims that Allāh had no knowledge until He created it, because this claim necessitates that Allāh was ignorant until He created the knowledge. And this claim is clear *kufr*.

And whoever denies an issue in the Tawhīd of Allāh and His Names and Attributes, and the issue is only known through the texts – with the condition that the issue is not among
the well-known issues – then if he rejects the truth when it comes to him then he is *kāfir*, and if he hangs on to a newly invented opinion of innovation which does not reach the
level of *kufr,* or he is in a situation where he could be excused, then he is still considered a *mubtadi’* (innovator) whose good deeds will never be accepted from him until he repents,
and along with this it is feared for him that he is considered among the *kuffār*.

## Al-Qurān is the Word of Allāh

Rejecting the Attributes of Allāh lead the Jahmiyyah – led by and named after Jahm ibn Safwān – to claim that the Qurān is created. If Allāh – according to them – does not speak,
then the Qurān cannot be the Speech and Word of Allāh, and so it must be created. Rather the people of *Sunnah* affirmed what the Qurān and *Sunnah* had already affirmed that the
Qurān is the Word of Allāh and not created. And they declared *takfīr* upon the one who says that the Qurān is created, due to what this saying contains of *kufr.* Among these types of *kufr* are:

- Rejecting that Allāh speaks.
- Claiming that Allāh did not have any knowledge until He created it. And this is based upon the fact that Allāh calls the Qurān knowledge. So this is a necessity of their claim.
- Allowing the invocation of something created. Allāh says (in the translation): **"Say call upon Allāh or call upon Ar-Rahmān."** And all the Names of Allāh according to them are created.
- Allowing seeking refuge with something created. The Prophet (ﷺ) encouraged the believers to say: **"I seek refuge with the perfect words of Allāh, from the evil which He has created."** And these words according to them are created.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And if anyone from the *mushrikūn* seek your protection, then protect him so he may hear the words of Allāh.”** (At-Tawbah 9:6)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And Allāh spoke to Musa directly."** (An-Nisā 4:164)

Jābir ibn ‘Abdullāh – (رضي الله عنه) – said:

***"The Prophet (ﷺ) used to present himself at the stopping place (for the pilgrims) and then say: 'Is there a man who will carry me to his people. For verily
Quraysh have forbidden me to declare the words of my Lord the Mighty and Majestic.’"*** (At-Tirmidhī, Ahmad, An-Nasāī – *sahīh* according to the conditions of Al-Bukhārī)

And 'Umar ibn Al-Khattāb (رضي الله عنه) said:

*"Verily this Qurān is the Word of Allāh – the Mighty and Majestic – so put it in its right place."* (Ar-Rad ‘alā Al-Jahmiyyah by Ad-Dārimī)

And Al-Lālakāī (d. 418h) after having mentioned the names of the scholars of the *Salaf* from different cities and countries by name, he said:

*"They all said: ‘The Qurān is the Word of Allāh and not created, and whoever says (that it is) created then he is kāfir.’ And these are five hundred and fifty persons or more from the tābi'ūn and
the followers of the tābi'ūn and the accepted leaders besides the good-doing Sahābah, opposite of (what has occurred in) the times and with the passing of years. And among them there are around
hundred leaders whose words were accepted and they (i.e. the people) adopted their religion according to their madhhab. And if I had busied myself with narrating the words of the people of
hadīth then their names would have reached many thousands. But I summarized and I deleted the chains of narration due to the summarization. And I narrated from these (scholars) time after time while no-one would reject anything from them."* (Sharh Usūl Al-I’tiqād by Al-Lālakāī 2/312)

So saying that the Qurān is created is an abominable innovation which without a doubt contains *kufr* to Allāh from several angles, and whoever claims this is a *kāfir.*

## The belief in the *Qadar* (Divine Decree)

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”Verily, everything We have created with Qadar.”** (Al-Qamar 54:49)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) explained how to belief in the *Qadar*, when he said:

***"Allāh decided the maqādīr (decrees) fifty thousand years before he created the heavens and the earth."*** (Sahīh Ibn Hibbān)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Verily Allāh has delegated an angel in the womb who says: ‘O my Lord, a semen drop. O my Lord, a clot. O my Lord, a lump of flesh.’ Then when Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – has
finished its creation, he (i.e. the angel) says: ‘O my Lord, unhappy or happy, male or female, and what is the provisions and when is the death?’ Then this is written (when he  is still) in the stomach of the mother."*** (Sahīh Muslim)

And Al-Walīd ibn ‘Ubādah ibn As-Sāmit (رضي الله عنهما) said:

*"My father – (رحمه الله)– advised me and said: ‘O my son. I advise you to believe in the Qadar, the good of it and the bad of it, because if you don’t believe in it, then Allāh will enter you into
Hellfire.’ He said: And I heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: ‘The first thing Allāh created was the pen, then He said to it: ‘Write.’ It said: ‘And what should I write.’ He said: ‘So
write what is now, and what will happen until the Hour is established.’"* (Abū Dāwūd, Ahmad, and At-Tirmidhī with a small difference – *sahīh*)

Among that which the people of *Sunnah* believe in regarding the *Qadar* is:

1. The belief that Allāh knows all things, in general and in detail, in all times, whether that has to do with His actions or the actions of His slaves.
2. The belief that Allāh has written the *Qadar* in *Al-Lawh Al-Mahfūdh* (the Book of Decrees).
3. The belief that whatever happens – of both good and evil – only happens by the Will of Allāh.
4. The belief that everything from the creation is created by Allāh, and among this are the deeds of the slaves, just as the evidences have proved.

The people who innovated false beliefs regarding the *Qadar* were called the **Qadariyyah**, and among their beliefs are:

* To reject that Allāh has pre-existing knowledge about everything and claiming that Allāh does not know what will happen until it occurs, including the deeds of the slave. Whoever says this he is a *kāfir*, due to rejecting the *Qadar* of Allāh.

* That the deeds of the slaves are created by the slave himself and not by Allāh. Whoever says this he is a *kāfir*, due to ascribing the attribute of creation to the slaves.

* To negate that Allāh has predetermined that which is evil and that He has only predetermined the good. Whoever says this he is a *kāfir*, due to rejecting a part of the *Qadar*.

* Then there were those who did not reject any of the four pillars of the *Qadar*, but due to wanting to exalt Allāh they would refrain from saying: *‘A person commits zinā, and steals,
  and drinks alcohol with Qadar (i.e. according to what Allāh has predestined for him).’* Whoever refrains from saying this is a *mubtadi’* (innovator).

Some people – as a refutation to the *Qadariyyah* – said that the deed of the slave is not even ascribed to the slave and that he has no will in that, rather the deeds of the slaves are ascribed to Allāh. These are the **Jabriyyah**, and this saying is clear *kufr*.

Rather the people of *Sunnah* are in between the two extremes. *Ahlus-Sunnah* does not negate the will for the slave; rather the will exists subject to the *Qadar* and *Mashīah* (Will) of Allāh the Exalted. Whatever Allāh wants then it will occur, and whatever He does not want, then it will never occur even.

**“And you do not will except that Allāh wills, Lord of the worlds.”** (At-Takwīr 81:29)

And verily has the correct understanding of this issue already been explained in the narrations from the *Salaf*.

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar (رضي الله عنهما) said:

***"’Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: ‘O Messenger of Allāh. Do you see these deeds which we do, are they a matter which has been determined or are they a new matter or an invented
matter?’ So he said: ‘It is something which has already been determined. So make deeds O son of Al-Khattāb, because it has all been made easy (in accordance with what has
already been decided). The one who is (decreed to be) from the people of happiness then he will make deeds for the happiness, and whoever is (decreed to be) from the people of unhappiness then he will make deeds for the unhappiness.’"*** (Sahīh At-Tirmidhī)

Abū Yahyā Al-A’raj (d. around 80h) the *mawlā* of Ibn ‘Ifrā (رضي الله عنه) said:

*"I came to Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) and with me was two men from those who mention the Qadar or reject it. So I said: ‘O Ibn ‘Abbās. What do you say about the Qadar, because these two
have come to ask you.’‛ And Ismā’īl said one time: ‚(They have come) to ask you about the Qadar. If he fornicates, and if he steals or drinks alcohol (is it then with Qadar)?’ So he (i.e. Ibn
‘Abbās) pulled away his shirt until he brought out his shoulder, and he said: ‘O Abū Yahyā. Maybe you are from those who reject the Qadar and deny it. By Allāh, if I knew that you were from them
or these two who are with you then I would have fought you. If he fornicates then it is with Qadar, and if he steals then it is with Qadar and if he drinks alcohol then it is with Qadar."* (Kitāb As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh)

Finally, there are some things to be aware of when it comes to the *Qadar* of Allāh. First and foremost is that Allāh is Just and He does not make injustice to anyone. Thus, everyone
who enters Hellfire, then that will be justified and deserved, and only after Allāh have sent messengers and prophets to them in order to warn them about the punishment of Allāh and inform them about what is obligatory and forbidden for them to perform.

Allāh – Exalted – said:

**”A group He guided, and for a group the misguidance became a reality. They verily took the *shayātīn*** (devils) **as allies** (or protectors) **besides Allāh, while they think that they are guided.”** (Al-A’rāf 7:30)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And We do not punish** (anyone) **before We send a messenger (to warn).”** (Al-Isrā 17:15)

And He - the Exalted – said:

**”And the book** (of deeds) **will be placed. Then you will see the criminals fearful for what is in it, and they will say: ‘Woe to us. What is this book which does not leave out any
small things or any big things, except that it has counted it.’ And they will find what they have done** (of deeds) **present in it. And your Lord does not make injustice to anyone.”** (Al-Kahf 18:49)

We as slaves cannot fully comprehend the *Qadar* of Allāh. Despite of this it is still obligatory to believe in it and it is strictly forbidden to ask questions like ‘how’ and ‘why’
when it comes to issues from the *Qadar* of Allāh. This is because the *Qadar* is among the secrets of Allāh, and doubting or rejecting anything from it only leads the slave to misguidance.

Allah – the Exalted – said:

**”He** (i.e. Allah) **is not asked about what He does, but they** (i.e. the slaves) **will be asked.”** (Al-Anbiyā 21:23)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

*"The slave does not believe before he believes in the Qadar, both the good of it and the bad."* (Musnad Imām Ahmad - *sahīh*)

Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And speaking about, arguing and disagreeing regarding the Qadar specifically is prohibited according to all the groups, because the Qadar is the secret of Allāh. And the Lord – tabāraka wa ta’ālā – prohibited the prophets from speaking about the Qadar."* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)

Al-Ājurrī (d. 320h) said:

*"It is not befitting for the Muslims to investigate and examine the Qadar. Because the Qadar is a secret from the secrets of Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla. Rather to believe in what the maqādīr (pl. qadar)
has brought of both good and evil is obligatory upon the slaves. After that the slave cannot feel secure from – if he searches in the Qadar – that he rejects the maqādīr of Allāh which are occurring upon the slaves, by which he deviates from the truth."* (Ash-Sharī’ah by Al-Ājurrī 7/;87)

## The status of the *Sahābah*

The Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ) are the best people to walk the face of the earth after the Prophets (عليه السلام). Allāh – the Exalted – chose them
to be the carriers of His religion and He praised them and approved of them in the Qurān. Thus, the correct belief regarding them is holding them at high esteem and witnessing for
them what Allāh and His Messenger (ﷺ) have witnessed for them of high rank and excellence, and not speaking bad about them or mentioning their faults.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And the first forerunners** (in īmān) **among the *Muhājirīn* and the *Ansār* and those who followed them in goodness. Allāh is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him,
and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment.”** (At-Tawbah 9:100)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh, and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating,
seeking bounty from Allāh and** (His) **Good Pleasure. Their sign is on their faces from the traces of** (their) **prostration** (during prayers)**. This is their description in the *Tawrāh*. But
their description in the *Injīl* is like a** (sown) **seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, it then becomes thick, and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the
sowers that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allāh has promised those among them who believe and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward.”** (Al-Fath 48:29)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Do not swear at my companions. Do not swear at my companions. Because by the One in whose Hand my soul is in, if one of you spent an amount of gold at the size of (the
mountain of) Uhud, then this would not be equal to the mudd [The amount which fits in two hands gathered. So the *mudd* of gold of the *Sahābah* spent for Allāh is better than the amount of gold equal to the mountain of Uhud of anyone other than them spent for Allāh] of any of them, and not even the half of it."*** (Sahīh Muslim)

Ibn Battah (d. 387h) narrated the agreement on not mentioning anything negative which occurred among the *Sahābah*, and testifying to their virtues and good deeds:

*"And after that we refrain from that which occurred of disputes between the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ). Because they verily testified the battles with him
and they preceded the people in virtues. So Allāh has verily forgiven them and ordered you to ask for forgiveness for them, and seeking nearness to Him by loving them. He made this obligatory upon the tongue of His Prophet while He knew what would occur among them and that they would fight against each other. They were given precedence over all of the creation because (the burden of)
the mistake and (what was done with) intent was removed from them, and every dispute which they had was forgiven for them. And do not look in the book ‘Siffīn’ and ‘Al-Jamal’ and ‘Waq’ah Ad- Dār’ and all other disagreements which occurred among them. And do not write it down for your self or for anyone else. And do not narrate it from anyone, do not read it for others, and do not
listen to it from the one who narrates it. The leaders of the scholars of this Ummah agreed upon this, of prohibition of that which we have described. Among them are: Hammād ibn Zayd, Yūnus ibn
‘Ubayd, Sufyān Ath-Thawrī, Sufyān ibn ‘Uyaynah, ‘Abdullāh ibn Idrīs, Mālik ibn Anas, Ibn Abū Dhib, Ibn Al-Munkadir, Ibn Al-Mubārak, Shu’ayb ibn Harb, Abu Ishaq Al-Fazari, Yusuf ibn Asbat, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Bishr ibn Al-Hārith and ‘Abdul-Wahhāb Al-Warrāq. All of these believed in: the prohibition of (narrating) it, and looking into it, and listening to it. And they warned against seeking it and dedicating (ones self) to gathering it."* (Al-Ibānah As-Sughrā by Ibn Battah)

And as for who is the best among the Companions (رضي الله عنهم) internally, then the best of them is Abū Bakr, then ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmān (رضي الله عنهم) according to the *hadīth* of Ibn ‘Umar (رضي الله عنهما) who said:

*"We used to consider (as the best), when the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) was alive and his Companions were great in numbers, Abū Bakr, then ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmān, and then we would remain silent.*" (Takhrīj Al-Musnad – its isnād is sahīh according to the conditions of Muslim)

And these three, along with ‘Alī (رضي الله عنه), are *Al-Khulafā Ar-Rāshidīn* (the rightly guided caliphs).

Then comes the ten who were given the glad tidings of Paradise by the Prophet (ﷺ) when he said:

***"Ten are in Paradise: Abū Bakr is in Paradise. ‘Umar is in Paradise. ‘Uthmān is in Paradise. ‘Alī is in Paradise. Az-Zubayr is in Paradise. Talhah is in Paradise. (‘Abdur-
Rahmān) ibn ‘Awf is in Paradise. Sa’d (ibn Abū Waqqās) is in Paradise. Sa’īd ibn Zayd is in Paradise. Abū ‘Ubaydah ibn Al-Jarrāh is in Paradise."*** (Sahīh Ibn Hibbān)

And then in general the Muhājirūn – who were those who emigrated with the Prophet (ﷺ) from Makkah to Madīnah – and the *Ansār*, who were the
inhabitants of Madinah who received and gave support to the Prophet (ﷺ) and Islām, may Allāh be pleased with all of them.

Those who oppose these principles are the **Shī’ah** and the **Rāfidah**. Among their misguided beliefs of innovation are:

* Believing that ‘Alī was better than ‘Uthmān. These people fell into an innovation.
* Hating and cursing the Companions (رضي الله عنهم) of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ). These people are kuffār, due to cursing the people whom Allāh chose to carry His message, those He gave the stamp of approval and those whom He is pleased with.
* Ascribing divine Attributes to the household of the Prophet (ﷺ) and ascribing them as partners with Allāh in worship. Among these are:
    * Those who invoke or ask for help from ‘Alī, Fātimah, Husayn (رضي الله عنهم) and others.
    * Those who claim that their 12 Imāms have knowledge about the unseen, or can arrange or have influence upon the affairs of the creation.
* Those who claim that parts of the Qurān are missing, or it has been substituted or changed or similar to this. These people are *kuffār*.
* Some claim that the latecomers have more knowledge and understanding in the religion that the *Sahābah* and the scholars of the *Salaf*.
* Some claim that Jibrīl (عليه السلام) made a mistake when He brought the message and prophethood from Allāh to Muhammad (ﷺ). These are *kuffār*.

Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنه) said:

***"I was with the Prophet (ﷺ) while ‘Alī was with him. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘O ‘Alī. In my Ummah there will come a
people who unrightfully will claim to love Ahlul-Bayt (the household of the Prophet). They have a nickname and are called the Rāfidah. Fight against them, for verily they are mushrikūn.’"*** (Majma’ Az-Zawāid by Al-Haythamī – its *isnād* is *hasan*)

And ‘Alī (رضي الله عنه) said:

*"After us there will come a people who unrighfully claim to love us. They are lying against us (and there are) māriqah (i.e. people who have left the religion). The sign of this is, that they curse Abū Bakr and ‘Umar."* (Sharh Usūl I’tiqād Ahlus-Sunnah by Al-Lālakāī)

## *Īmān* is in speech and deeds, it increases and decreases

The people of *Sunnah* define *īmān* as being both in words and deeds ***[When the Salaf said īmān is in speech and deeds, then they indented: the speech of the heart and the tongue, and the deeds of the heart and the limbs. The speech of the heart is the belief and the conviction, while the
deeds of the heart are the likes of hope, fear, longing etc. As for the speech of the tongue and the deeds of the limbs, then this is clear]*** , and that the *īmān* of the slave increases when he performs good deeds and it decreases when he performs sins.

Allah – the Exalted – said:

**”Those to whom the people said: ‘Verily have the people gathered against you, so fear them.’ But this** (only) **increased them in *īmān* and they said: ‘Allāh is sufficient for us, and** (He is) **the Best Disposer of affairs.”** (Āli ‘Imrān 3:173)

The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Īmān is seventy odd or sixty odd categories. The best of them is Lā ilāha illa Allāh and the lowest of them is removing the harm from the road. And hayā (shyness) is from īmān."*** (Sahīh Muslim and many others)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) also said:

***"The believers with the most complete īmān are those with the best manners. And the best of you are those who behave best towards their women."*** (Ahmad, At-Tirmidhī and Abū Dāwūd – hasan sahīh)

And Jundub ibn ‘Abdullāh (رضي الله عنه) said:

*"We were with the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) and we were young boys, so we would learn about īmān before we would learn the Qurān. And then we would learn the Qurān, and by that we would increase in īmān."* (Ibn Mājah - sahīh)

And ’Abdullāh ibn Mas’ūd (رضي الله عنه) use to make the du’ā (invocation):

*"O Allāh, increase us in iman, in certainty and in understanding."* (As-Sharī’ah by Al-Ājurrī 7/262)

These narrations – along with many many more – all give evidence to the fact that deeds are a part of *īmān*, and that the *īmān* can increase and thereby also decrease.

A misguided group called the **Murjiah** innovated the claim that the deeds of the limbs are not included in *īmān*, which meant that whoever believes in his heart and testifies to īmān
with his words, then he has a complete *īmān* and no sin would harm him in his *īmān*. **And with this they opened the door for sinning for the *Ummah***. Because according to their
claim sins had no consequences upon the completeness of *īmān*. The *Salaf* would refute and disagree with the claim of the Murjiah, warn against them and consider them as innovators.

‘Abdullāh ibn Imām Ahmad (d. 290h) narrated:

*"Suwayd ibn Sa’īd narrated to me, from ‘Abdullāh ibn Maymūn who said: I heard Ibn Mujāhid say: ‘I was with ‘Atā ibn Abū Rabāh when his son Ya’qūb came, and then said: ‘O father, some of
our companions claim that their īmān is like the īmān of Jibrīl (‘alayhi as-salām).’ So he said: ‘O my son. They have lied. The īmān of the one who obeys Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – is not like the īmān of the one who disobeys Allāh the Exalted.’"*(Kitāb As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh)

And Fudayl ibn ‘Iyyād (d. 187h) said:

*"The foundation of īmān for us and its branches – after the Shahādah and the Tawhīd, and after the testimony to the Prophet (ﷺ) that he brought the Message, and after performing the obligatory acts of worship, is speaking truthfully, preserving the trust, leaving
betrayal, fulfilling the promise, keeping the bond of kinship, giving advice to all of the Muslims and being merciful with all people in general."* (As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh)

So the belief of the *Salaf* is in accordance with the Qurān and *Sunnah*, which states that the deeds of the limbs all are included in *īmān*.

The **Jahmiyyah** went even further astray when they claimed that *īmān* merely is the knowledge or acknowledgement of the heart, without any speech or apparent deeds. And
the *Salaf* declared them as *kuffār* because of this, due to claiming that whoever curses Allāh or performs a *nāqid* (nullifier) from the *nawāqid* of Islām, then even if he gets the *hukm* of a
*kāfir* in dunyā, then he could still be a believer in the sight of Allāh due to the *īmān* of his heart. And this necessitate that the Jews, Christians and even Iblīs all could be believers.

Wakī’ ibn Al-Jarrāh (d. 197h) said:

*"Verily did the Murjiah say: ‘The acknowledgement (with the heart and tongue) of that which has come from Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – is sufficient from the deeds.’ And the Jahmiyyah said: ‘The knowledge in the heart regarding that which has come from Allāh, is sufficient from the words and the deeds’, and this is kufr."* (As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh)

Harb ibn Ismā’īl Al-Karmānī (d. 280h) said:

*"And whoever claims that the knowledge (or acknowledgement) of the heart benefits, even if he does not utter it, then he is a jahmī."* (As-Sunnah by Al-Karmānī)

And verily did they agree upon the *kufr* of the Jahmiyyah.

The *bid’ah* of the Murjiah – i.e. excluding the deeds of the limbs from *īmān* – is the starting point of many innovations as it will be clear.

## The one who leaves the prayer is *kāfir*

As a consequence of the saying of the Murjiah – that the deeds of the limbs are not from *īmān* – these innovators would not declare *takfīr* upon the one who leaves the prayer. The
scholars included the issue of declaring *takfīr* upon the one who leaves the prayer among the principles of the *Sunnah*, due to the clear evidences narrated regarding it, and the innovators turning away from it.

The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"There is nothing between the slave and shirk, except leaving the prayer. So whoever leaves it has verily committed shirk."*** (Sahīh Ibn Mājah)

And he (ﷺ) said:

***"The covenant which stands between us and them is the prayer, so whoever leaves it he has verily committed kufr."*** (At-Tirmidhī, Ahmad, Ibn Hibbān, An-Nasāī - *sahīh*)

And it is narrated with a *hasan* chain of narration:

*"From Mujāhid Abū Al-Hajjāj, that he asked Jābir ibn ‘Abdullāh (رضي الله عنه): ‘What used to differentiate between kufr and īmān for you (i.e. the Sahābah) in the time of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ)?’ He (i.e. Jābir) said: ‘The prayer.’"* (Sharh Usūl Al-I’tiqād Ahlus- Sunnah by Al-Lālakāī 4/829)

And Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) said:

*"The Companions of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) would not consider leaving any of the deeds as kufr, except the prayer."* (Al-Hākim – *sahīh* according to the conditions of Al-Bukhārī and Muslim)

And Ayyūb As-Sikhtiyānī (d. 131h) said:

*"Leaving the prayer is kufr. There is no disagreement regarding this."* (Ta’dhīm Qadr As-Salāh by Al-Marwazī)

And Ishāq ibn Rāhūyah (d. 238h) said:

*"It has verily correctly been narrated from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) that the one who leaves the prayer is kāfir. And likewise was the opinion of the people of knowledge
from the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) until this day of ours; that the one who leaves the prayer on purpose without an excuse, until its (prescribed) time leaves, he is kāfir."* (Ta’dhīm Qadr As-Salāh by Al-Marwazī 2/929)

And Al-Hasan Al-Basrī (d. 110h) said:

*"It has reached me that the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) used to say: ‘Between the slave and between him committing shirk whereby he commits kufr, is that he leaves the prayer without any excuse."* (Sharh Usūl I’tiqād Ahlus-Sunnah by Al-Lalakai)

And Imām Ahmad (d. 241h) said:

*"And there is nothing from the deeds where leaving it is kufr, except the prayer. Whoever leaves it, then he is kāfir."* (Usūl As-Sunnah by Imām Ahmad – the *riwāyah* of ‘Abdūs)

Thus, the so-called ‚disagreement‛ which has occurred regarding the one who leaves the prayer, whether he commits *kufr* or not by this, is a disagreement that did not exist
between the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), nor those who followed them in goodness. And the opinion that the one who leaves the prayer does
not commit *kufr* and leave Islām has its basis in the *‘aqīdah* of the Murjiah, and therefore it is an innovation which is not to be taken into consideration.

The one who leaves the prayer is *kāfir*, and the one who excuses him is following a *shubah* (doubt) which originates from *irjā* (i.e. the belief of the Murjiah). The correct *ahādīth* have already refuted the claim that the one who leaves the prayer is still a Muslim. The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Verily leaders will be appointed over you (from which) you will acknowledge (some of their deeds) and reject (others). So whoever hates (their bad deeds) is innocent. And
whoever rejects it is safe. But whoever is pleased and follows it (is destroyed). They said: ‘O Messenger of Allāh, should we not fight against them?’ He said: ‘No, not as long as they pray (the five prayers).’"*** (Sahīh Muslim)

Ishāq ibn Rāhūyah (d. 238h) said about this hadīth:

*"‚And in it is the destruction of the Murjiah."* (Musnad Ibn ‘Awānah)

This is because the Prophet (ﷺ) made the prayer the distinguishing factor between Islām and *kufr* in this life (as long as no nawāqid are performed), and by leaving the prayer the leader is no longer obeyed, which means he becomes a *kāfir*.

The Prophet (ﷺ) also said in a longer *hadīth* about the events of the Day of Judgment after some people have entered Hellfire:

***"Then He orders the angels to bring out from Hellfire whoever who did not associate partners with Allāh in worship (in dunyā), among those whom Allāh wants to show
mercy, from those who testify to Lā ilāha illa Allāh. So they (i.e. the angels) will recognize them in the fire by their trace of prostration. The fire eats (all of) the son of
Adam except the trace of prostration, (because) Allāh forbade the fire to eat the trace of prostration."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

This *hadīth* also proves – in accordance with all the other evidence – that whoever wants a hope of exiting the fire after having being thrown in it, must be from the people of the prayer, since the trace of prostration only appears on the one who used to pray.

## The one who performs a major sin is a Muslim with faulty *īmān*

*Ahlus-Sunnah* believes that the person who performs a major sin – which is lesser than major shirk and major *kufr* – deserves the threat which is connected to the sin performed,
just as this has been narrated in the texts from the Qurān and *Sunnah*. But he does not leave Islām by this, nor is he judged as being in Hellfire forever if he dies without having
repented. Rather he is a Muslim with the basis of his *īmān* (i.e. its basis is there but his *īmān* is faulty due to his sin), and a *fāsiq* (sinner) due to his major sin. And he is under the *Mashīah* (Will) of Allāh; if He wants He will punish him according to his sin, and if He wants to He will forgive and pardon him.

Muhammad ibn Ismā’īl Al-Bukhārī (d. 256h) said:

*"Chapter: The sins are from the affairs of jāhiliyyah, and whoever performs them then takfīr is not declared on the one performing it, except if it is shirk. Due to the saying of the Prophet (ﷺ): **"You are verily a person in which there is some jāhiliyyah."** And the words
of Allāh the Exalted: **"Verily Allāh does not forgive that partners are associated with Him (in worship), and He forgives whatever is besides this for whomever He wants."***

***30** – Sulaymān ibn Harb narrated to us and said: Shu’bah narrated to us, from Wāsil Al-Ahdab,
from Al-Ma’rūr ibn Suwayd who said: I met Abū Dhar in Ar-Rabdhah and he was wearing a cloak
and his slaveboy was also wearing a cloak. So I asked him regarding this. So he said: ‚I verily
cursed at a man by and dishonored him by (saying evil words about) his mother. So the Prophet (ﷺ) said to me: "**O Abū Dhar. Did you dishonor him by his mother?
You are verily a person in which there is some jāhiliyyah. Your slaves are your brothers.
Allāh has made them under your hands (i.e. authority). So whoever has his brother under
his hand, then let him feed him with what he feeds himself, and clothe him with what he
clothes himself. And do not burden them with what is too much for them, and if you
burden them (with hard work) then help them.’"*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

Imām Ahmad (d. 241h) said:

*"And whoever dies from the Ahlul-Qiblah (i.e. those who pray) as a muwahhid then he is prayed upon, and forgiveness is asked for him and asking for forgiveness for him is not forsaken. Nor is the prayer upon him left due to a sin which he committed, whether it is small or big. His affairs are with Allāh the Exalted."* (Usūl As-Sunnah by Imām Ahmad – the *riwāyah* of ‘Abdūs)

The **Murjiah** – as this has already gone forth – claims that sins have no effect upon *īmān*, and that whoever commits a major sin still has a complete *īmān* as long as his *īmān* in
speech and the heart remains. And these people are innovators if their claim does not exceed this claim.

The **Khawārij** deviated by claiming that the one who commits a major sin is a *kāfir* and will remain in Hellfire forever if he dies without having repented from the sin. The
**Mu’tazilah** took from the Khawārij that the one who commits major sin remains in Hellfire forever without the possibility of Allāh forgiving and pardoning him, but they
differed with the Khawārij in what they named him in *dunyā*. While Khawārij says he is *kāfir*, the Mu’tazilah claimed that the one who commits a major sin is neither a Muslim nor
a *kāfir*, rather he is in *al-manzilah bayn al-mazilatayn* (the position between the two positions).

These beliefs are all innovations that oppose the Qurān and the *Sunnah* in accordance with the understanding of the *Salaf*, and the evidences have already refuted all of these claims.

The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"The people of Paradise will enter Paradise and the people of Hellfire will enter Hellfire. Then Allāh – the Exalted – will say: ‘Bring out from Hellfire anyone who had īmān at the
size of a mustard seed in his heart. Then they will come out of it, when they (already) have become black (like coals)."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

So this *hadīth* with clarity proves that some believers will enter Hellfire due to their sins, and then they will be brought out of it due to their *īmān*.

## *Al-Istithnā* (the exception)

*Ahlus-Sunnah* refrain from describing themselves or others as believers (*muminūn*) without adding: *‘In shā Allāh’* or ‘I hope’ or something similar to this. This is referred to as al- *istithnā* (the exception) in *īmān*. The reasons for this exception is that a Muslim should not purify himself, nor should he claim to be guaranteed the entrance into Paradise, nor does
he know about his *īmān* whether it is complete or not, since this would mean that he has fulfilled all the obligatory acts of worship without the slightest flaw along with having avoided everything of the forbidden, and this all then have been accepted by Allāh. And they followed the Prophet (ﷺ) and the Sahābah (رضي الله عنهم) in this belief and practice.

The Prophet (ﷺ) said to the people in the graves:

***"As-Salāmu ‘alaykum the abode of a believing people. And verily will we in sha Allāh (if Allāh wills) follow you."*** (Sahīh Ibn Hibbān)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said in a longer *hadīth* in which he described the testing in the grave:

***"Then it will be said to him: ‘Look at what Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – has preserved for you. And then an opening will be opened for him to Paradise and he will look at its beauty and
whatever is in it. Then it will be said to him: ‘This is your place in it.’ And it will be said:  ‘Upon certainty were you, and upon did you die, and upon it you will be resurrected in shā Allāh."*** (Musnad Imām Ahmad – sahīh)

And ‘Alqamah (d. between 60h and 73h) said:

*"A man said in front of ‘Abdullāh (ibn Mas’ud): ‘I am verily a believer.’ So he said: ‘(Why don’t you) say: ‘I will verily be in Paradise.’ Rather we say: We have believed in Allah, His angels, His Books and His messengers.’"* (Al-Musannaf by Ibn Abī Shaybah, and As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh)

And ‘Abdullāh ibn Ahmad (d. 290h) narrated:

*"Abū Bakr ibn Abū Shaybah narrated to me, from Jarīr ibn ‘Abdul-Hamīd, from Mughīrah, from Simāk ibn Salamah Ad-Dabbī, from ‘Abdur-Rahmān ibn ‘Ismah who said: ‚I was with ‘Āishah (رضي الله عنها) when the messenger of Mu’āwiyah (رضي الله عنه) came to her with a gift.
So he said: ‘Amīr Al-Muminīn has sent this for you.’ So she said: ‘You are the believers in shā Allāh ta’ālā, and he is your amīr, and I have verily accepted his gift.’"* (As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh)

The **Murjiah** negated the *istithnā* and forbade it and called it doubting in ones *īmān*. This is because īmān for them is only in belief and speech, so whoever professes to *īmān* –
according to them – has complete *īmān*. The people of *Sunnah* disagreed with them on this issue, and some took a softer stance in this issue, under the condition that the person not making *istithnā* otherwise had the correct *‘aqīdah* regarding the definition of *īmān*.

‘Abdullāh ibn Ahmad (d. 290h) narrated:

*"Muhammad ibn Sulaymān Luwayn Al-Asadī narrated to me and said: ‚It was said to Sufyān: ‘Are you a believer?’ So he said: ‘I do not doubt in my īmān, and your question to me is a bid’ah. I do not know what status I have with Allāh, if I am unhappy or my deeds have been accepted or not?"* (Kitab As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh)

And he also narrated from his father Imām Ahmad:

*"I asked my father about a man who says: Īmān is in speech and deeds, and it increases and
decreases, but he does not make istithnā, is he a murjī? He said: ‘I hope that he is not a murjī.’"* ***[The one who has the correct fundamental beliefs, but refrains from performing the *istihnā*, then Imām Ahmad here said that he hopes that he is not a *murjī*, while other scholars would declare him a *murjī* based
upon this only. This shows the importance and obligation of *al-istithnā*, and that it is an issue which should not be underestimated]***

## Belief in the Books and the Messengers

Allāh – the Exalted – sent messengers and revealed books as a guidance, a mercy and an argument upon mankind and *jinn*. The people of *Sunnah* believe in all the messengers and
prophets of Allāh, and they believe in all the books sent from Allāh, except that the Qurān which was revealed to the final Messenger Muhammad (ﷺ) rendered the previous legislations abrogated and no longer to be followed.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”O you who believe, believe in Allāh and His Messenger and the Book which was revealed to His Messenger and the book which was revealed before. And whoever
rejects Allāh, His angels, His books, His messengers and the Last Day, then he has verily gone far astray.”** (An-Nisā 4:136)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”The Messenger belives in what have been revealed to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. They all believe in Allāh, His angels, His books and His messengers. We do not differentiate between any of His messengers.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:285)

Ibn Zayd (d. 159h) said:

**"We do not differentiate between any of His messengers.** *Just as the people did – i.e. Banū Isrāīl – (when) they said: ‘So-and-so is a prophet and so-and-so is not a prophet. And we believe in so-and-so, but we do not believe in so-and-so.’"* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

And Jābir ibn ’Abdullāh (رضي الله عنه) narrated:

*"That ’Umar ibn Al-Khattāb came to the Prophet (ﷺ) with a writing which he came upon from some of the people of the books, and he read it for the Prophet (ﷺ). So he became angry and said: ‘Are you confused regarding it, O son of Al-
Khattāb?! By the One in Whose Hand my soul is in, I have verily come to you with it (i.e. the Straight Path) white and pure. Do not ask them about anything, because they (might) inform you
about some truth which you then will reject, or some falsehood which you then will believe. By the One in Whose Hand my soul is in, if Mūsā was living then he would have no other option but to  follow me."* (Musnad Imām Ahmad)

And among the books revealed by Allāh which were mentioned in the Qurān and *Sunnah* are the *Suhuf* (scrolls) which were revealed to Ibrāhīm (عليه السلام), the Zabūr which was revealed to Dāwūd (عليه السلام), the Tawrāh which was revealed to Mūsā (عليه السلام), the Injīl which was revealed to ‘Isa (عليه السلام) and finally the Qurān which was revealed to Muhammad (ﷺ).

As for the prophets and messengers sent by Allāh which it is obligatory to believe in, then many of them (عليهم السلام) are mentioned in the following. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”We verily revealed to you** (O Muhammad)**, just like we revealed to Nūh and the prophets after him. And we revealed to Ibrāhīm, Ismā’īl, Ishāq, Ya’qūb, Al-Asbāt, ‘Īsā,  Ayyūb, Yūnus, Hārūn and Sulaymān. And we gave the Zabūr to Dāwūd.”** (An-Nisā 4:163)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”And We bestowed upon him** (i.e. Ibrāhīm) **Ishāq and Ya’qūb, and all of them We guided. And Nūh we guided before (them). And from his offspring Dāwūd, Sulaymān, Ayyūb, Yūsuf, Mūsā and Hārūn. And such we reward those who do good. And Zakariyyā, Yahyā, ‘Īsā and Ilyās, all of them among the righteous. And Ismā’īl, Al-Yasa’a, Yūnus and Lūt, and all of them we preferred over *Al-‘Ālamīn*** (all that exists)**.”** (Al-An’ām 6: 84-86)

All of them called to Tawhīd, while their legislations and rulings would differ according to what Allāh revealed to the messengers and prophets of their time and people.

Allah – the Exalted – said:

**“And verily, We have sent among every *Ummah*** (nation) **a Messenger** (proclaiming)**: ‘Worship Allāh** (Alone)**, and avoid** (or keep away from) ***tāghūt*** (everything worshipped besides Allāh)**.’”** (An-Nahl 16:36)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"I am more entitled (i.e. nearest) to ‘Īsā ibn Maryam in the dunyā and ākhirah, and the prophets are paternal brother; their mothers are different and their religion is the same."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

And Allah – the Exalted – said:

**“For everyone We have made a law and and a path.”** (Al-Māidah 5:48)

Qatādah (d. 118h) said in the *tafsīr* of the verse:

*"He says: A way and a Sunnah. And the Sunan are different. The Tawrāh has a sharī’ah (legislation), the Injīl has a sharī’ah and the Qurān has a sharī’ah. In it Allāh allows what He wants and He prohibits what He wants as a test, in order to know who will obey Him and those who will disobey Him. But the religion is one (and the same) which is the only one that will be accepted: The Tawhīd and Ikhlās (sincerity) for Allāh, which (all) the messengers came with."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

## Belief in the Angels

The angels are a creation from the creations of Allāh. They are created from light, they are obedient to Allāh, and they do what they are ordered. Furthermore the angels are not female. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”All praise is due Allāh the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and the One who made the angels messengers having wings** (either) **two, three or four.”** (Fātir 35:1)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Over it** (i.e. Hellfire) **are** (appointed) **angels who are harsh and severe. They do not disobey Allāh in what He orders them, and they do what they are ordered.”** (At-Tahrīm 66:6)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”Verily those who do not believe the Hereafter, they verily give the angels female names.”** (An-Najm 53:27)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"The angels were created from light, the jinns were created from a smokeless flame of fire and Adam was created from what has been described for you."*** (Sahīh Muslim)

Among the angels which have been described in the Qurān and *Sunnah* are: Jibrīl who is responsible for delivering the revelation, Mikāīl who is responsible for rain and
vegetation, Isrāfīl who is responsible for blowing the Horn, Malak Al-Mawt who is responsible for taking the souls, *Hamalah Al-‘Arsh* (the Bearers of the Throne), *Al-Hafadah*
(those who protect the slaves), the Guardians of Paradise, the Guardians of Hellfire and others. And it was verily narrated in the Sahīh Al-Bukhārī and Sahīh Muslim that two angels were fighting alongside the Prophet (ﷺ) in the battle of Uhud, defending him.

## *‘Adhāb Al-Qabr* (the punishment in the grave)

*Ahlus-Sunnah* believes in what have been correctly narrated from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) regarding the punishment in the grave and its pleasures. Among these correct narrations are:

The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

*"When the believer is made to dwell in his grave then (the angels) come to him. Then he testifies to Lā ilāha illa Allāh and that Muhammad is Rasūl-Allāh. And that is (the meaning of) His words:* **"Allāh makes those who believe firm, with the firm word."** (Ibrāhīm 14:27)" (Sahīh Al- Bukhārī)

And ‘Āishah (رضي الله عنها) narrated:

*"That a Jewish woman entered upon her and mentioned the punishment in the grave. She said to her: ‘May Allāh give you refuge from the punishment in the grave.’ So ‘Āishah asked the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) about the punishment in the grave (i.e. whether
or not people will be punished in their grave).’ So he said: ‘Yes, the punishmet of the grave’ ‘Āishah (رضي الله عنها) said: ‘After that I never saw the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) pray any prayer, except that he sought refuge from the punishment of the grave (in it)."* (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

And Asmā bint Abū Bakr (رضي الله عنهما) said:

*"The Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) got up and gave a speech. And he mentioned in it the fitnah of the grave which the person will be put through. So when he mentioned this the Muslims made a loud noise." (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

Most of the **Khawārij** rejected the punishment of the grave without looking at the evidence which had been narrated that establishes its truth. Others among the other sects also rejected it.

## Belief in what has been narrated about *Al-Ākhirah*

From the principles of *Sunnah* is the belief in the aspects of *ākhirah* *[footnote*: **Some of these issues have been described in next sections**] which have been narrated in the Qurān and the *Sunnah* without rejecting any of it. Among these things is
that a Horn will be blown and then the slave will be resurrected from his dwelling in the grave, to the standing and reckoning on the Day of Judgment. The *kuffār* will be ordered to
follow whatever they have worshipped in *dunyā* to Hellfire and Allāh will not speak to them. Allāh will speak to the remaining slaves (the Muslims and the hypocrites) about what they used to do in *dunyā*; some He will cover over and others He will expose.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing (on the Day of Judgment), looking on.”** (Az-Zumar 39:68)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said in a longer *hadīth*:

***"The people will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection, then He will say: ‘Whoever used to worship something (in dunyā) then let him follow it. So some of them will follow the sun, some of them will follow the moon and some of the will follow the tawāghīt (pl. tāghūt). And left will be this Ummah and its hypocrites."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) also said:

***"The believer will be brought close on the Day of Judgment to his Lord – ‘azza wa jalla – until He will put His Side upon him and He will make him admit to his sins, so He will
say: ‘Do you acknowledge (your sins)?’ So he will say: ‘My Lord, I acknowledge.’ So He will say: ‘I verily covered over them for you in dunyā and I verily forgive them for you
today.’ Then he will be given the book of his good deeds. But as for the disbelievers and the hypocrites, then they will be called openly in front of the witnesses. These are the ones who lied against Allah."*** (Sahīh Muslim)

And ‘Āishah (رضي الله عنها) narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***Whoever is called to reckoning on the Day of Resurrection will be punished. So I (‘Āishah) said: ‘Did Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – not say:*** **"Then he will verily have an easy reckoning?"** (Al-Inshiqāq 84:8)***’ So he said: ‘That is not the reckoning. Verily that is the
review (or presentation) [*footnote:* *This is the easy account which is described in the previous hadīth where Allāh will mention the sins of the slave and make him acknowledge them*] . Whoever is argued against in the reckoning on the Day of Resurrection will be punished."*** (Sahīh Muslim)

So the *kuffār* will stay in Hellfire forever, the Muslims who were not forgiven for their sins will stay there temporarily and some Muslims will enter into Paradise without being
punished and they will stay there forever. Paradise and Hellfire have already been created and prepared for its inhabitants, and they will both exist forever and never cease to exist.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And hurry to a forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise whose width is like the heavens and the earth, prepared for the God-fearing.”** (Āli ‘Imrān 3:133)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And those who believe and do good deeds, We will verily enter them into gardens under which rivers flow. They will remain therein forever. A promise of truth from Allah. And who is more truthful in speech than Allah?”** (An-Nisā 4:122)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And fear Hellfire which have been prepared for the disbelievers.”** (Ālu ‘Imrān 3:133)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”Verily Allah has cursed the the disbelievers and prepared for them a blazing fire. They  will remain therein forever. They will not find any protector nor any helper.”** (Al-Ahzāb 33:64-65)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***I looked into Paradise and I saw that most of its inhabitants were poor people. And I looked into Hellfire and I saw that most of its inhabitants were women."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And everything from that which Allāh has enjoined upon it to disappear then it will disappear, except Paradise, Hellfire, the Throne, The Footstool, the Horn, the Pen and the Tablet. None of these
things will ever disappear. Then Allāh will resurrect the creation on the Day of Resurrection upon that (i.e. religion and state) which He made them die upon, and He will hold them accountable for
whatever He wants. A group will be in Paradise and a group will be in the blazing fire. And He  will say to the rest of the creation which has not been created to remain: ‘Be dust’."* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)

## *Ash-Shafā’ah* (the intercession)

The *shafā’ah* (intercession) of the Prophet (ﷺ) has correctly been narrated in the *Sunnah* with *tawātur* [*footnote:* **A subject which has been narrated with *tawātur* (continuous recurrence) – or a *mutawātir hadīth* – is a *hadīth* or a subject that has been narrated from so many people that it practically is impossible for them to agree upon lying or that they should all make the same mistake without intending it**] .
And this is the belief that the Prophet (ﷺ) will intercede on the Day of Resurrection, by the permission of Allāh, for
his *Ummah* to enter faster into Paradise, for some people from his (ﷺ) *Ummah* who were thrown in the fire due to their sins that they will be taken out of it, and that some sinners from his (ﷺ) *Ummah* will avoid entering into Hellfire even though they deserved it due to their sins.

In a longer *hadīth* narrated by Anas ibn Mālik (رضي الله عنه) the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Then they will come to me (i.e. the people, after having asked the other prophets to intercede for them) and I will ask permission from My Lord. Then when I see Him I will fall down in sujūd. Then He will let me (stay there), as much as Allāh wills. So it will be  said: ‘O Muhammad, raise your head. Speak, and you will be listened to. Ask, and you
will be given, and intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.’ So I will raise my head and praise my Lord with praise which my Lord will teach me. Then He gives me a limit (of people) and I bring them out of Hellfire and enter them into Paradise."*** (Al- Bukhārī, Muslim, Ibn Hibbān and others – sahīh)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Every prophet has an invocation which he has made for his ummah. And I have verily saved my invocation as an intercession for my Ummah of the Day of Resurrection."*** (Al-Bukhārī and Muslim – sahīh)

The **Mu’tazilah** rejected that the Prophet (ﷺ) will make intercession for those who have entered into the fire, due to their belief that whoever dies
while he has not repented from a major sin he has committed, then he will enter the fire and Allāh will not forgive him, nor show him mercy.

The **Khawārij** rejected that the Prophet (ﷺ) will make intercession for those who have entered into the fire, due to their belief that whoever commits a major sin, then he is *kāfir* and will enter Hellfire forever.

And these beliefs are a continuance and expanding of their original innovation which they believed in.

Hanbal (d. 273h) said:

*"I said to Abū ‘Abdullāh – i.e. Ahmad ibn Hanbal: ‘What was narrated from the Prophet (ﷺ) regarding the shafā’ah (intercession)?’ So he said: ‘These are correct ahādīth. We believe in them and consent to them. And everything which was narrated from the
Prophet (ﷺ) with good chains of narration, then we believe in it and consent to it.’ I said to him: ‘Will some people exit the fire (after having entered it)?’ He said: ‘Yes. If we don’t consent to what the Messenger came with and we repell it, then we are rejecting the order of Allāh. Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – said: **"And whatever the Messenger gives you, then
take it. And what he prohibits you from then refrain from it."** (Al-Hashr 59:7) I said: ‘And the shafā’ah?’ He said: ‘How many (narrations) are narrated from the Prophet (ﷺ) regarding the shafā’ah and the hawd (basin). These people reject it and they speak (from
their desires), and it (i.e. rejecting it) is the opinion of a group from the Khawārij; that Allāh verily do not bring out from Hellfire anyone after He entered him into it. And all praise is due to Allāh who turned away from us what He has tested them with."* (Sharh Usūl I’tiqād Ahlus-Sunnah by Al-Lālakāī)

## *Ar-Ruyah* (seeing Allāh in *ākhirah*) – and a mention of *Al-‘Uluw* (the aboveness)

Seeing Allāh in the next life is an issue which has been proved by the Qurān and the *mutawātir Sunnah*. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“Some faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord.”** (Al-Qiyāmah 75:22-23)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, a caller will call out: ‘O people of Paradise, you verily have a meeting with your Lord, (in which) He wants to fulfill (His covenant)
with you.’ So they will say: ‘What is it? Did He not whiten our faces, make our scales heavy, enter us into Paradise and protect us from the fire?’ He said: Then He will remove
the cover and they will look at Him. And He did not give them anything more beloved to them, than looking at Him. And this is the extra (mentioned in Sūrah Yūnus)."*** (Ahmad, Ibn Mājah and An-Nasāī with a slight difference - sahīh)

And Suhayb ibn Sinān Ar-Rūmī (رضي الله عنه) narrated:

***"From the Prophet (ﷺ) regarding the words of Allāh – jalla dhikruhu (in the translation): **"For those who do good is the best** (reward) a**nd extra."** (Yūnus 18:76) He said: ‘The best (reward) is Paradise, and the extra is looking at the Face of Allāh. No darkness will cover their faces, nor humiliation after they have looked at Him."*** (Al-Kāmil fī Ad-Du’afā by Ibn ‘Adī – *hasan* or *sahīh*)

And Jarīr ibn ‘Abdullāh (رضي الله عنه) said:

***"We were sitting with the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) when he looked at the moon on the night of full-moon. Then he said: ‘Verily you will be presented to your Lord – ‘azza wa jalla – and you will see Him, just as you see this moon, you have
no difficulty in seeing it. So if you are capable of avoiding to miss a prayer before the rising of the sun and before its setting, then do so.’ He said: Then he recited: ‚And exalt your Lord by praising Him before the rising of the sun and before its setting."*** (Tā-hā 20:130)" (Sahīh Ibn Mājah)

The **Mu’tazilah**, the **Jahmiyyah** and the **‘Ashā’irah** rejected seeing Allāh in the *ākhirah*
based upon philosophy and their lust and desires.

This philosophy and so-called logic, also drove the Jahmiyyah, the Mu’tazilah and the
Ashā’irah to reject the *‘Uluw *(aboveness) of Allāh, which is Him being above the heavens
separated from His creation with a border. Some of the Mu’tazilah said that Allāh is
everywhere, while other said that Allāh is nowhere. The ‘Ashā’irah accepted the *‘Uluw*
(aboveness) of Allāh in His Power and Arrangement, but rejected ‘*Uluw Adh-Dhāt*
(aboveness of the Being of Allāh), while *Ahlus-Sunnah* believe in it all. The Jahmiyyah said
that Allāh is everywhere, which includes Him being on earth. And all those who reject
*'Uluw Ad-Dhāt* (the aboveness of the Being of Allāh) are *kuffār*.

‘Abdullāh ibn Al-Mubārak (d. 181h) said:

*"We know our Lord – the Mighty and Majestic – above the seven heavens upon the Throne separated from His creation by a border. And we do not say like the Jahmiyyah (that He is) right here. (And he pointed with his hand towards the ground)."* (As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh – *thābit ‘anhu*)

And Imām Ahmad acknowledged these words from ‘Abdullāh ibn Al-Mubārak. Abū Bakr Al-Khallāl (d. 311h) narrated:

*"And Muhammad ibn ‘Alī Al-Warrāq informed us (and said): Abū Bakr Al-Athram narrated to us (and said): Muhammad ibn Ibrāhīm Al-Qaysī narrated to me and said: ‘I said to Ahmad ibn Hanbal: It is said about Ibn Al-Mubārak when it was said to him: ‘How do we know our Lord?’
Then he said: ‘In the seventh heaven upon His Throne with a border (i.e. separated from His creation).’ So Ahmad said: ‘It is (also) like that with us.’"* (Ithbāt Al-Hadd by Ad-Dashtī)

And Abū Hātim Ar-Rāzī (d. 277h) said:

*"We have met the scholars from all of the lands; Hijāz, ‘Irāq, Shām and Yaman. And their madhhab was: that Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – is upon His Throne, separated from His creation, just as He has described Himself in His Book and upon the tongue of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) without (describing) how."* (Sharh Usūl I’tiqād Ahlus-Sunnah by Al-Lālakāī 1/197)

The scholars have described the issue of *‘Uluw* as an issue known from *fitrah*. It is a necessity which the slave feels within him; that his Lord is above him in the heaven and
therefore when he turns to Him in repentance and supplication, he turns towards the heaven. So there is no excuse in rejecting the *‘Uluw*, rather some of the dirtiest of *kuffār* and
*zanādiqah* who ascribed to Islām were those who claimed the opposite of *‘Uluw;* that Allāh is everywhere or nowhere. And from this claim came many abhorrent sayings which cannot even be mentioned.

Allāh – the Exalted – said: **“And He is the Subduer, above His slaves.”** (Al-An’ām 6:18)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Do you feel secure that He, Who is in the heaven [*footnote:* **When Allāh is described as being in ‘the heaven’ in verses, *ahādīth* and in the sayings of the *Salaf*, then what is meant is according to the description of ‘Abdullāh ibn Al-Mubārak when he said: *"Above the seven heavens upon the Throne separated from His creation by a border."* This is in accordance how the Arabs would understand and use this term in this context.**] , will not cause the earth to sink with you?’”** (Al-Mulk 67:16)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said in a longer *hadīth*:

***"So he said to her (i.e. a slavegirl): ‘Where is Allāh?’ She said: ‘In the heaven.’ He said:  ‘And who am I?’ She said: ‘You are the Messenger of Allāh.’ He said: ‘She is verily a believer.’"*** (Muslim, Abū Dāwūd, An-Nasāī and Ahmad – *sahīh* according to the conditions of Muslim)

Ad-Dārimī (d. 280h) said:

*"So in this hadīth of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) there is an evidence for that a person, if he does not know that Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – is in the heaven and not on earth,
then he is not a believer. And if he (i.e. this person) was a slave and then he was freed, then it is not allowed to count him as (freeing) a believing slave because he does not know that Allāh is in the
heaven (i.e. in aboveness). Is it not seen that the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) made the sign of her īmān her knowledge of Allāh being in the heaven."* (Ar-Radd ‘alā Al-Jahmiyyah by Ad-Dārimī)

And ‘Abdur-Rahmān ibn Muhammad Al-Handhalī (d. 327h) said:

*"Harb ibn Ismā’īl Al-Karmānī informed me in that which he wrote to me, that the Jahmiyyah are the enemies of Allāh, and they are the ones who claim that the Qurān is created, that Allāh did not
speak to Mūsā, that He is not seen in the ākhirah, that no place is known for Allāh and that He isnot upon a Throne, nor a Footstool. And they are kuffār, so be aware of them."* (‘Uluw lil-‘Alī Al-Ghaffār by Adh-Dhahabī)

## *Al-Hawd* (the Basin)

The *ahādīth* which have been narrated about the *hawd* (basin) of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) are also on the level of *tawātur*. Among these *ahādīth* are:

The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Verily the size of my basin is like (the distance) between Aylah and San’ā in Yemen. And in it there are vessels as the numbers of the stars."*** (Sahīh Muslim)

And he (ﷺ) said:

***"Verily some people of my companions will come to me at the basin, and when I recognize them they will be taken away from me. So I will say: ‘My companions.’ Then it will be said: ‘You do not know what they have innovated after you. [*footnote:* **This means: the hypocrites, those who returned to *kufr* after their Islām, and it even includes those after him (ﷺ) who were Muslims but fell in innovations. This hadīth cannot be used to accuse the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) for deviating, since Allāh informed that He was pleased with them**] ’"*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

And Abū Dhar Al-Ghifārī (رضي الله عنه) said:

***"I said: ‘O Messenger of Allāh. What are the vessels of the basin?’ He said: ‘By Him in Whose Hand the soul of Muhammad is, it’s vessels are more than the number of the stars in the sky and its planets, verily (shining) on a dark clear night. These would be the vessels of Paradise. He who drinks out of it (i.e. the basin) would never feel thirsty after
that. In it runs two spouts from Paradise. Whoever drinks from it will not feel thirsty (ever again). It width is like its length; the distance between ‘Ammān and Aylah. Its water is whiter than milk, and sweeter than honey."*** (Sahīh Muslim)

Some of the **Mu’tazilah** and **Khāwarij** rejected the *hawd* (basin) based upon innovative beliefs. Some claimed inconsistency in the narrations, while others refused to accept the location of the basin which was narrated, and thus rejecting it in totality.

## *Al-Mīzān* (the Scale)

*Ahlus-Sunnah* believe that the *mīzān* (scale) mentioned in the Qurān and *Sunnah*, which will be brought on the Day of Resurrection, is a real scale upon which the deeds of the slaves will be weighed according to the Qurān and *Sunnah*.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“Whoever's scale becomes heavy, then these are the successful. And whoever's scale becomes light, then these are those who have lost themselves. In Hellfire they will remain.”** (Al-Muminūn 23:102-103)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

*"Two words that are light upon the tongue, but heavy on the scale and beloved to Ar- Rahmān: SubhānAllāh Al-‘Adhīm, SubhānAllāh wa bihamdihi."* (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

And ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas’ūd (رضي الله عنه) narrated:

***"That he was harvesting siwāk from an Arāk tree and he had thin shins. The wind blew and made him fall over, so people laughed at him. So the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ): ‘Who are you laughing at?’ They said: ‘O Prophet of Allāh, at the thinness of his shins.’ So he said: ‘By the one in Whose Hand my soul is, they will both be heavier on the Scale than the mountain of Uhud."*** (Ahmad, At-Tayālisī and Al-Bazzār – sahīh li-ghayrihi)

The **Mu’tazilah** rejected the *mīzān* under the claim that the deeds of the slaves are not masses that have a weight, and therefore it cannot be weighed. This is because they did not believe in the unseen, and they compared the issues of *dunyā* with issues of *ākhirah* leading them to reject things that they could not understand.

## *As-Sam’u wat-Tā’ah* (Listening and obeying) the Islamic rulers

*Ahlus-Sunnah* believes that as long as the Islamic ruler does not show apparent *kufr* from himself, as long as he rules with the *Sharī’ah* – unlike the situation of the countries today –
and as long as he establishes the prayer in the land, then it is obligatory to listen to him and obey him, and it is forbidden to rebel against him or fight against him, and thereby
splitting the unity of the Muslims. And this is applicable even if he should sin or perform injustice to those who are under his authority.

The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

*"The best of your leaders are those whom you love and they love you. And you pray for them and they pray for you. And the worst of your leaders are those whom you hate and they hate you. And you curse them and they curse you. They said: ‘We said: O Messenger of Allāh, should we not oppose them (or separate from them) in this case?’ He said: ‘No, as long as they establish the prayer
among you. No, as long as they establish the prayer among you. Verily, whoever a leader is appointed over and he sees him perform something of disobedience to Allāh, then let him hate what he performs of disobedience of Allāh, but he should verily not pull his hand back from obedience (towards him)."* (Sahīh Muslim)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"Whoever sees something from his leader which he hates (or dislikes), then let him have patience in it. Because there is no-one who separates from them Jamā’ah (even a) hands span and then dies, except that he dies the death of jāhiliyyah."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

And Hudhayfah ibn Al-Yamān (رضي الله عنه) said:

***"I said: ‘O Messenger of Allāh, we were verily in an evil state and then Allāh sent us the good which we are in now. So is there any evil after this good?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ I said: ‘I there any good after this evil?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ I said: ‘So is there any evil after this good?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ I said: ‘How?’ He said: ‘After me there will be leaders who do not follow my guidance, nor do they adhere to my Sunnah. And among them there will be men whose hearts are the hearts of shayātīn (devils) in the bodies of a human.’ He (Hudyafah) said: ‘I  said: How should I act, O Messenger of Allāh, if I live to see this?’ He said: ‘You listen and obey the leaders. Even if your back is beaten and your wealth is taken, then listen and obey.’"*** (Sahīh Muslim)

And ‘Ubādah Ibn As-Sāmit (رضي الله عنه) said:

***"The Prophet (ﷺ) called us and we pledged allegiance to him. And among that which held us accountable for was: That we pledged allegiance to listen
and obey in what we were able to perform and what we disliked, in our difficult times and at our times of ease, to give precedence (to the leader) over ourselves, and not do dispute
the issue (of leadership) with its people except if you see clear kufr regarding which you have a clear proof from Allāh."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

The **Khawārij, Mu’tazilah** and **Ahl Ar-Raī** (people of opinion) considered the rebellion against the sinning Muslim leaders as allowed and obligatory, and they included this in *al- amr bil-ma’rūf wan-nahī ‘anil-munkar* (ordering good and forbidding evil).

Imām Ahmad (d. 241h) said:

*"And whoever rebels against a leader among the leaders of the Muslim, while the people have united behind him and they have acknowledged the Khilāfah for him – no matter in what way,
either being pleased with him or by force – then this rebel has divided the unity of the Muslims, and he has opposed the narrations from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ). So if the
one who rebels against him (i.e. the leader) dies, then he dies the death of jāhiliyyah. And it is not allowed for anyone among the people to fight against the leader, nor to rebel against him. So
whoever does this, then he is an innovator who is not upon the Sunnah and the (straight) path."* (Usūl As-Sunnah by Imām Ahmad – the riwāyah of ‘Abdūs)

Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And it is not allowed to fight against the leader, nor to rebel against him, even if he is unjust. And this is due to the words of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) to Abū Dhar Al-Ghifārī: ‘Have patience, even if he is an Ethiopic slave’, and his words to the Ansār: ‘Have patience
until you meet me at the hawd (basin)’. And it is not from the Sunnah to fight the leaders, because verily in it is the destruction of the dunyā and the religion."* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)

And Al-Ājurrī (d. 320h) said:

*"Whoever is appointed over you as a leader, whether he is an Arab or a non-Arab, or he is black or white or a foreigner, then obey him in that which is not a sin towards Allāh ‘azza wa jalla. (This), even if he is unjust to you in a right which you have (over him). And even if he unjustly hits you
and violates your honor and takes your wealth. Then this should not lead you to bring out your
sword against him to fight him. And do not rebel along with a khārijī (rebeller) in order to fight against him (i.e. the leader). And do not encourage others to rebel against him, rather you should
have patience with him.:* (As-Sharī’ah by Al-Ājurrī)

## Judgments in *dunyā* are according to the outwardly

*Ahlus-Sunnah* believes that in *dunyā* the judgments upon persons are according to the outwardly. So whoever utters, performs or shows shirk and *kufr*, or the signs of *shirk* and
*kufr*, then he is judged as a *kāfir*. And whoever shows Islām and the signs of Islām, such as saying the *Shahādah*, establishing the prayer along with the other rituals of Islām, then he
is judged as a Muslim in this life, and his internal affairs are between him and Allāh. The Qurān and *Sunnah* have established this fact in a very clear way.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“But if they repent (from shirk) and establish the prayer and pay the zakāh, then they
are your brothers in religion. And We explain the verses in details for people who have
knowledge.”** (At-Tawbah 9:11)

The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"I have ordered to fight the people until they testify to Lā ilāha illa Allāh and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh, and they establish the prayer and they pay the zakāh. And if they do this, then they have protected their blood and wealth from me, except by the right of Islām, and their account is with Allāh the Exalted."*** (Sahīh Al- Bukhārī)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***Whoever prays our prayer, faces our Qiblah and eats from what we have slaughtered, then this is the Muslim who has the protection of Allāh and the protection of His Messenger. So do not betray Allāh in His protection (by violating it)."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhari)

And ’Ubayd-Allāh ibn ’Adī ibn Al-Khiyār [*footnote:* **There is a difference of opinion whether or not he was a Companion of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) or he was among the *tābi’ūn***] (d. 95) narrated:

***"While the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) was sitting amongst his  companions a man came to him and informed him about a secret. And it was not known
what he said to him in secret until the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) spoke out loud, and he (i.e. the man) was asking for permission to kill a man from the
hypocrites. So the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) said when he spoke  out loud: ‘Does he not bear witness to Lā ilāha illa Allāh and that Muhammmad is Allāhs
Messenger?’ So the man said: ‘Yes, but he has no shahādah (i.e. it is not valid).’ He said:  ‘Does he not pray?’ He said: ‘Yes, but he has no prayer (i.e. it is not valid).’ So the
Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) said: ‘These are the ones whom Allāh has prohibited me from.’"*** (Muwatta by Imām Mālik and Al-Musnad by Imām Ahmad)

Humayd ibn Abu Humayd At-Tawīl (d. 142h) said:

*"Maymun ibn Siyāh asked Anas ibn Mālik (رضي الله عنه) and said: ‘O Abū Hamzah, what prohibits the blood of a Muslim and his wealth?’ So he said: ‘If he testifies to Lā ilāha illa Allāh and
that Muhammad is Rasūl-Allāh, he faces our Qiblah, he prays our prayer and he eats our slaughter, then he is a Muslim. He has what the Muslims have (of rights), and upon him is what is upon the  Muslims (of obligations)."* (Al-Bukhārī and An-Nasāī – sahīh)

The **Khawārij** that occurred after the death of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) deviated from this principle by declaring *takfīr* upon a Muslim who committed a
major sin, which is lesser than major shirk and major *kufr*. The Khawārij of today uprooted this principle from the *Sunnah* and claim that a person is not judged according to what he
shows in the apparent; rather he is judged upon assumption and the situation of the majority of the people. So when the majority of the people in reality do not know the truth,
then the unknown person is assumed to be equal to them in their hāl (situation) and therefore given the same judgment as them, without taking the apparent signs into consideration.

This obviously contradicts the Qurān and the Sunnah, and it necessitates for them that they declare *takfīr* based upon their own assumptions and feelings regarding his inner situation. The *Sunnah* from the Prophet (ﷺ) clearly forbids this and commands us to judge upon the apparent.

The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"I was verily not ordered to search in the hearts of the people, nor to split open their bellies."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

And ’Umar ibn Al-Khattāb – (رضي الله عنه) – said:

*"Verily the people were judged according to the revelation in the time of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), and verily has the revelation stopped. And verily do we (now) judge
you now from what appears to us from your deeds. So whoever shows us good we consider trustworthy and we bring him close and as for his inner self then we have nothing to do with that,
Allāh will hold him accountable for his inner self. And whoever shows us evilness then we don’t  trust him, and we don’t believe him even if he says that his inner self is good."* (Sahīh Al-Bukhari)

Ash-Shāfi’ī (d. 204h) said:

*"And that the judgment of Allāh – the Exalted – in dunyā is accepting the dhāhir (apparent) of the people and that He took responsibility for their inner selves. And He did not allow for a sent prophet
nor for anyone else from the creation that they should judge except according to the apparent, and He besides them took the responsibility for the inner selves due to Him being the only One who has knowledge about that."* (Al-Umm 6/178)

And Al-Khallāl (d. 311h) narrated:

*"Muhammad ibn Abū Hārūn narrated to me and said: Muhammad ibn Abū Hashīm narrated to us and said: Fawrān passed some of the masāil (issues) of Abū ‘Abdullāh to me and said: I asked him. He said: I said: ‘Some of the Jews say: I bear witness to Lā ilāha illa Allāh and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh.’ So he (i.e. Imām Ahmad) said: ‘If he doesn’t want Islām (then it is not accepted as his entrance into Islām), but if he came to accept Islām and testifies to Lā ilāha illa Allāh and that Muhammad is His slave and messenger, and he prays, then what Islām is more complete
than that? Is it not narrated from the Prophet (ﷺ) that he said: **"I have been ordered to fight the people until they say Lā ilāha illa Allāh. Then if they say that, then they have prevented me from their blood and wealth."**""* (Al-Jāmi’ li-’Ulūm Al-Imām Ahmad 4/172)

Harb ibn Ismā’īl Al-Karmānī (d. 280h) said:

*"And withholding the hand (i.e. not harming) Ahlul-Qiblah (those who pray), and we do not
declare takfīr upon any of them due to a sin (they performed), and we do not exit them from Islām
due to any deed, except if there is a hadīth regarding it. Then the hadīth is narrated just as it has
been reported, and it is believed in and accepted."* (As-Sunnah by Harb Al-Karmānī)

Imām Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And no-one from the people of the Qiblah (i.e. those who pray) are exited from Islām (i.e. declared takfīr upon) before he rejects a verse from the Book of Allāh – the Exalted – or he rejects something of the narrations of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), or he prays to other than Allāh, or he slaughters for others than Allāh. But if he does any of these things, then it is obligatory
upon you to exit him from Islām (i.e. to declare takfīr upon him). But if he does not perform any of these things, then he is a beliver and a Muslim in name, not in reality"* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al- Barbahārī)

And this is because it is only Allāh who knows the reality. And this innovation is not new,
rather can it be found in the books of the scholars when they mentioned the Khawārij.

Al-Lālakāī (d. 418h) narrated:

*"From Humayd ibn Hilāl (who said) regarding ‘Ubādah ibn Qurt Al-Laythī that he said to the Khawārij when they took him in Al-Ahwāz: ‘Be content with from me what the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) was content with when I accepted Islām. They said: ‘And what was
the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) content with from you?’ He said: ‘I came to him and testified to Lā ilāha illa Allāh and Muhammadu Rasul-Allāh, and he accepted that from
me.’ He (i.e. Humayd) said: ‘But they rejected (to accept that) and killed him.’"* (Sharh Usul I’tiqād Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah)

And this is a spot-on description of the modern day Khāwarij who under no circumstances will give the hukm (judgment) of Islām to anyone except if they have heard the meaning of Tawhīd and its issues from him. But since this is a practice which does not have any basis
in the *Sunnah*, it is an innovation which renders the one who believes in it an innovator. Furthermore, the most extreme of these people will declare *takfīr* upon those who follow
the belief described in the *ahādīth* and the scholars in this issue. So they describe the *manhaj* of the Muslims – all the way from the Prophet (ﷺ), to the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم), their followers and whoever came after them of scholars – as *kufr*, and
that the one who believes in it have not rejected *tāghūt*. This opinion without a doubt is *kufr* and *zandaqah* due them rejecting the clear evidences and the agreement of the Muslims.

## Adhering to the *Sunnah* and leaving the innovator

It is very important to understand that in order to be upon the way of the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) and those who followed them in goodness, a person must hold a
correct belief and firmly adhere to that which has it foundation in the sources that has been described in this book. There is no exception or excuse when it comes to not following or believing in the *Sunnah*.

Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And there is no permission for anyone to take (i.e. believe in) something which the Companions of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) were not upon, or that a man invites to something which was innovated by someone before him by the people of innovation, then (in that case) he is like the one who innovated it. So whoever claims this, or holds this opinion, then he has
verily rejected the Sunnah and opposed the truth and the Jamā’ah, and he has allowed the desires (i.e. innovation) and he is worse for this Ummah than Iblīs. And whoever knows what the people of innovation left of the Sunnah and that which they separated themselves from, and he then adheres to it, then he is a follower of the Sunnah and a follower of the Jamā’ah. This person is deserving of  being followed, aided and protected, and he is among those towards whom the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) advised."* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)

Ibn ’Umar (رضي الله عنه) said regarding the people who did not believe in the *Qadar* (Divine Decree):

*"If you met those people then inform them that I am free from them and they are free from me."* (Sahīh Muslim)

‘Abdullāh ibn Imām Ahmad (d. 290h) said:

*"And two men from the people of hawā (desires) entered upon Muhammad ibn Sīrīn and said: ’O Abū Bakr, we will narrate a hadith to you.’ He said: ‘No’. They said: ‘Then we will recite a verse
from the Book of Allāh – the Mighty and Majestic – for you.’ He said: ‘No. Either you will get up  away from me, or I will get up (away from you).’ He said: So the two men got up and went out. So
some of the people said: ‘O Abū Bakr, what would it harm you if they recited a verse from the Book  of Allāh the Mighty and Majestic.’ So Muhammad ibn Sīrīn said: ‘I verily fear that they would  recite a verse for me, and they would distort it and that would be established in my heart.’"* (As- Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh)

And the *āthār* (narrations) from the *Salaf* are filled with the disassociation from the people of innovation. Because in the disassociation of the people of innovation lies the
preservation of the religion and the protection of one’s self. Al-Barbahārī – (رحمه الله) – gathered the meaning of cutting off and boycotting the people of innovation when he said:

*"So (be aware of) Allāh, (be aware of) Allāh regarding yourself. And obligatory upon you is the  āthār (narrations) and the companions of the athar, and following (these). Because verily is the religion (only) following; that is (following) the Prophet (ﷺ) and his
Companions – may the Pleasure of Allāh be upon all of them. And those who came before us did not  invite us in ambiguity, so follow them and relax. And do not exceed the athar and the people of
athar, and stop at the ambiguous of the Qurān and the hadīth, and do not make analogy with  anything nor seek a plot from yourself with which you answer the people of innovation. Because  you are verily ordered not to speak with them and not to make yourself possible for them (to  manipulate). Do you not know that Muhammad ibn Sīrīn – along with his virtues – did not answer
a man from the people of innovation in a single issue, nor did he listen to one verse from the Book of Allāh from him? So it was said to him: (‘Why?’) So he said: ‘I fear that they would distort it (i.e. the verse) so that something (of innovation) would befall my heart.’"* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al- Barbahārī)

A mistake that many people fall in today – perhaps with good intention – is that they gladly enter into discussion or debate with the people of innovation. Or they seek to correct the people of innovation and refute them in conversation with them. This is not from the way of the *Salaf* at all. Rather this is an unwise boldness and lack of fear of being
infected with the poison of the innovators. Because there is no doubt that many of the people of innovation have been given eloquence, and they all bring some sort of distorted argument for their innovation. So the *Sunnah* in this issue is the refrain from every form of conversation with them.

Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And if he (i.e. the innovator) comes to debate, then be aware of him. Because verily in debating there is arguing, discussing, fighting, disputing and the anger, and you have verily been prohibited
from all of it, and it removes a person from the Path of the Truth. And it has not reached us from anyone among our fuqahā and ‘ulamā that he would discuss, debate or dispute. Al-Hasan said: ‘The wise person does not argue nor does he flatter. He spreads his wisdom, then if it is accepted then he praises Allāh, and if it rejected then he praises Allāh.’ And a man came to Al-Hasan and said: ‘I
want to debate with you in the religion.’ So Al-Hasan said: ‘As for me, then I already know my religion. So if your religion has strayed from you, then go and search for it.’ And the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) heard a people outside the door of his room, when one of them said: ‘Did Allāh not say this?’ And the other one saying: ‘Did Allāh not say that?’ So he went out
very angry and said: ‘Is this what you have been ordered to do? Or is it with this I have been sent to you; that you use something from the Book of Allāh as argument against something else (from the Book of Allāh)?’ So he prohibited them from debating."* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)

So whoever indulges in debate and discussion with the people of innovation and then goes astray, he should blame nobody but himself if his heart becomes afflicted with their poison, and he no longer is able to remove it again.

## The place of *takfīr* in the religion

The issue of *takfīr* is also an easy issue for the one who knows the place of the issue of *takfīr* in the religion. Every saying or deed has its category in the religion and must therefore be
treated accordingly. So whoever is able to recognize the category of the saying or deed, then by that he will know whether or not declaring *takfīr* is obligatory upon him or not.
Some saying and deeds might be clear cut in their indication of *kufr,* while other might be ambiguous, in which case the Muslim can ask his brother what he has intended by it, and then judge based upon the given explanation.

As for the categories where a saying or a deed of *kufr* can occur, then these are three:

**The first:** Issues of the fundamentals of Tawhīd and *shirk* akbar (**major** *shirk*). These are issues which are related to the knowledge of Allāh which is known through *fitrah*, such as the description of Allāh with Attributes of perfection that negates faults and deficiencies for Allāh, such as that Allāh is Living, Seeing, Hearing, All-Powerful, All-Knowing, the
Creator, the Sustainer, the Arranger of affairs, the *‘Uluw* (Aboveness) of Allāh and that He Speaks. These are the things that if a person rejects them or doubts regarding them, then
he has rejected perfection for Allāh or doubted regarding it, which is *kufr* before and after  the establishment of the argument. Furthermore the types of worship are also included in this category. So if the slave dedicates a type of worship for others than Allāh with his  deeds or beliefs, then this also are from the things which are *kufr* before and after the  establishment of the argument.

Thus, if the Muslim sees any mistakes from another Muslim in this category – whether this
is in words or deed – then it is obligatory to exit him from the religion and consider him a
non-Muslim until he repents from what he has committed of *kufr*.

‘Abdullāh ibn Ahmad (d. 290) narrated:

*"I heard my father – (رحمه الله) – when ‘Alī ibn Al-Jahm asked him regarding the one who holds the opinion of the Qadar, is he a kāfir? He said: ‘If he rejects the knowledge [*footnote:* **This means: If he rejects that Allāh has pre-existing knowledge about everything which will happen before it happens**] (he is kāfir). If he says: ‘Verily Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – did not have knowledge until He created knowledge, (first) then He
knew.’ So he rejects the knowledge of Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – then he is kāfir."* (As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh)

Muhammad ibn Ismā’īl At-Tirmidhī (d. 280h) said:

*"I heard Al-Muzanī say: ‘Tawhīd is not valid for anyone before he knows that Allah is upon the Throne with His Attributes (i.e. and he establishes the Attributes of Allah).’ I said to him: ‘Such as what?’ He said: ‘Hearing, Seeing, Knowing, Omnipotent."* (‘Uluw lil-‘Alī Al-Ghaffār by Adh- Dhahabī, Siyar Al-A’lām An-Nubalā and others)

Al-Bukhārī (d. 256h) said:

*"Chapter: The sins are from the affairs of jāhiliyyah, and whoever performs them do not commit kufr due to performing it, except if it is shirk."* (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

Ad-Dārimī (d. 280h) said:

*"So whoever is not certain that the Qurān is not created he has not yet believed, because it (i.e. the Qurān) is the kalām (speech) of Allāh itself. Because if he believed in that it is the kalām of Allāh
itself, then he would have known with full certainty that the speech is an attribute of the one who can speak (or the one who speaks). And Allāh with all of His Attributes and His Speech is not created."* (Al-Naqd by Ad-Dārimī)

And whoever dives into the books of the *Salaf* will find that they are filled with similar
words of *takfīr* upon whoever rejects or denies anything from this category of knowledge
or that he should dedicate an act of worship to others than Allāh the Exalted.

**The second:** The well-known issues, or issues which are known from the religion by necessity. And the difference between these two are, that the well-known issues might be
well-known in some places and not others, while that which is known from the religion with necessity is something that both scholars and normal people among the Muslims
know, and even the non-Muslims know this about Islām and therefore the Muslim cannot be excused in it. So when an issue becomes well-known in one place it is dealt with in that
place as if it was known from the religion by necessity. And whatever falls in this category then there is no excuse in the mistake in it, except for the one who has just entered into
Islām – under the condition that the issue is not known even amongst the *kuffār* – and the one who lives far away in the desert and did not have access to knowledge.

Among these issues are: The five prayers, the pilgrimage, the fast, the alms, the prohibition of pork and alcohol and interests and immoral deeds. So whoever rejects any of these then he is not excused due to the status of these issues, and *takfīr* is declared upon
him immediately due to the argument already being established in such issues, unless he is among the two mentioned types of people. So if a person says: ‘There are only 3 prayers
in Islām’, or *‘Zinā* (fornication) is allowed’ or ‘The fast is not obligatory’ then *takfīr* is declared upon him directly due to the issues being either well-known or known from the religion with necessity.


**The third:** The hidden issues. And these are the issues that the normal Muslims do not have knowledge about, and where the scholars are those who have knowledge about these things. If a person among the normal Muslims should have a mistake in some of these  issues, then *takfīr* is not declared upon him before the establishment of the argument which if he denies it he becomes a *kāfir*.

And among these issues could be: the details of inheritance, the judgment of the child born from *zinā*, the *kaffārah* (expiation) for the one who wore pants in his pilgrimage etc. So
whoever holds a wrong belief in these issues then *takfīr* is not declared upon him until the argument – which is sufficient for declaring *takfīr* upon the one who rejects it – with certainty has been established upon him, and he thereafter still rejects the clear evidences after they came to him.

Ash-Shāfi’ī (d. 204h) explained the second and the third category when he said:

*"If someone would say to me: ‘What is the knowledge? And what is obligatory for the people regarding knowledge?’ Then I would say to him: ‘The knowledge is of two types. (The first is) the general knowledge. No-one who is of age and not insane is allowed to be ignorant regarding this.’ He says: ‘Such as what?’ I say: ‘Such as the five prayers, that the people owe to Allāh to fast in
Ramadān and perform the pilgrimage if they are capable and (paying the) zakāh from the wealth, and that He has forbidden fornication, killing, stealing and alcohol. And whatever has the same meaning of that which the slaves are obliged to understand, perform and give from themselves and their wealth. And that they avoid that which He has forbidden for them. And this category all of it
is from the knowledge which is present in text of the Book of Allāh, and it is generally present among the people of Islām; the normal people among them (i.e. not scholars) convey it from those of their normal ones who passed away. They narrated it from the Messenger of Allāh and they do not disagree in the narration of it or in its obligation upon them. This is the general knowledge in which
it is not possible to make a mistake in the information or the interpretation, and it is not allowed to dipute regarding it."*

*He says: "Then what is the second type?" I say to him: ’That which comes close to the slaves from the branches of the obligatory deeds, and that which is specific for it of judgments and other things,
among that which there is no text from the Book, nor is their in the most of it a text from the Sunnah. And if there in any of it exists some Sunnah, then it is verily among the informations of
the specific people (i.e. scholars) and not the information of the normal people. And in some of it, it is possible to interpret it (in different ways) and to achieve understanding of it through qiyās (analogy).’"* (Ar-Risālah by Ash-Shāfi’ī)

A last detail to mention here is the difference between two types of persons which must be taken into consideration. One person may not believe in an Attribute of Allāh – which can
only be known through the textual evidence – due to the knowledge about it not having reached him yet. In this case he is informed and the argument is established upon him, and if he insists on his rejection then *takfīr* is declared upon him. But another person who rejects the same attribute, but does this due to his *jahmī* principles of kufr (i.e. to reject the
Names and Attributes of Allāh in general) then he is not excused, due to his *kufr* lying in having fundamental principles of *kufr* in his beliefs. So this type of person would not be excused even if the knowledge has not yet reached him, because he has already fallen in *kufr* before that. And like this every situation is looked into in detail when it comes to *takfīr*.

## The predecessors vs. the latecomers

There is no doubt whatsoever, that the one who leaves the books of the *Salaf* (predecessors) and solely studies the religion from the books of the latecomers, he will
remain in doubt and confusion. The reason for this is that the books of the *Salaf* contain the truth which they heard from the *Sahābah* (رضي الله عنهم) and they were very strict on
not accepting the opinions of the innovators and those who were accused in their religion, either of lying or of believing in an innovation. Thus you have chapters and even books
from the *Salaf* that dealt with the leaders of misguidance, discrediting them and warning against them.

But as for the latecomers then these principles were and are not maintained with the same vigor as the *Salaf* did. And the result of this is, that people who held beliefs that for the
*Salaf* were considered innovation – and in come cases *kufr* – are referred to as Imām or *Shaykh* or *Hāfidh*, while this is giving their name and their words a status in the religion
which is not befitting for them. This then results in the people accepting their words, or at least considering it a valid opinion in the religion, while in reality it is not. Furthermore
many of the latecomers would describe the innovators as being from *Ahlus-Sunnah* while they in reality are not. And like this confusion arises, because how can an innovator be an
Imām? And why are people referring to such and such person as *Shaykh*, when he in reality is a *kāfir*? And why does a presumably acknowledged and accepted scholar speak in favor of *kufr* and *innovation*?

The solution to this problem lies in studying in the books of the *Salaf* to get to know their *‘aqīdah*. With this a person acquires a scale with which he can measure the words of those
who came after them. Because the lesson is not in the name or status of a person, rather the lesson lies in that which agrees with the Qurān and the *Sunnah* according to the understanding of the *Salaf*. And what is besides this is misguidance, even if most of the people are gathered upon it.

Hudhayfah ibn Al-Yamān (رضي الله عنه) said:

*"Fear Allāh O you readers (of the Qurān)! And take the path of those who came before you. Because by Allāh, if you remain steadfast upon that, you have verily went ahead with a great advantage. But if you leave it (in order to go) right or left, then you have verily went far astray."* (Az-Zuhd war-Raqāiq by Ibn Al-Mubārak)

And Imām Mālik (d. 179h) said:

*"The last of this Ummah will not be correct except through that which the first of it was correct by. So whatever was not from the religion at that time will never be from the religion today."* (Kitāb Al-I’tisām by Ash-Shātibī)

And Imām Ash-Shāfi’ī (d. 204h) said:

*"Whoever speaks some words regarding the religion, or regarding something of these desires (i.e. bida’) and he does not have an imām (leader) who said this before him from the Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions, then he has verily invented something new in Islām.*" (Al-
Intisār li-Ashāb Al-Hadīth by Abū Al-Mudhaffar As-Sam’ānī)

And Ishāq ibn Abdur-Rahmān ibn Hasan (d. 1319h) from the da’wah of Najd said:

*"And whoever nurtures himself by the words of the latecomers, without honoring the famous books of the people of Sunnah, such as Kitāb As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh ibn Al-Imām Ahmad, and Kitāb
As-Sunnah by Al-Khallāl, and Kitab As-Sunnah by Al-Lālakāī, and Ad-Dārimī and others than them, he will remain in confusion and misguidance."* (Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah 4/336)

Thus, acquiring ones *‘aqīdah* and fundamental principles from the books of the *Salaf* is not an issue which under any circumstances can be underestimated. Rather, whoever does not
establish his fundamental, his *manhaj*, his method and his beliefs upon what he finds in the books of the *Salaf*, then he is not safe from falling into misguidance without even noticing it.

## Seeking knowledge, adhering to the *Jamā’ah* and maintaining *īmān*

Seeking the knowledge which is sufficient to have the correct *‘aqīdah* is an obligation upon every single individual, no matter who he is or where he comes from, and verily does the correct knowledge and *‘aqīdah* come before speech and deeds. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“So know, that *Lā ilāha illa Allāh*** (no-one is worthy of worship besides Allāh) **and ask for forgiveness for your sin, and for the believing men and women.”** (Muhammad 49:19)

What testifies to this fact – as it has previously been explained – is that Allāh does not accept anything except if it is not performed with Tawhīd, nor does He – the Exalted – accept anything except if it is not performed according to the *Sunnah*.

Add to this, that if a person performs *shirk* while worshipping Allāh then all of his deeds will be in vain, and on the Day of Judgement Allāh will turn it into scattered dust. Allāh – the – Exalted – said:

**”That is the guidance of Allāh with which He guides whomever He wills. And if they had committed *shirk*, then everything which they used to do would be in vain (**or come to nothing**).”** (Al-An’ām 6:88)

And as for the innovator – whose innovation has not reached the level of *kufr* which takes him out of the fold of Islām – then Allāh will not accept anything of his good deeds, not the obligatory nor the voluntary.

Al-Awzā’ī (d. 158h) said

*"Some of the people of knowledge said: Allāh does not accept from the innovator any prayer, nor fast, nor sadaqah, nor jihād, nor hajj, nor ‘umrah, nor any obligatory or voluntary acts.’"* (Kitāb Al-I’tisām by Ash-Shātibī 1/187)

And Al-Hasan Al-Basrī (d. 110h) said:

*"Allāh does not accept for an innovator any fast, or prayer, or hajj, or ‘umrah until he leaves it (i.e. his innovation)."* (Sharh Usūl I’tiqād Ahlus-Sunnah by Al-Lālakāī 1/138-139)

So the first step on the road to salvation is seeking knowledge and correcting the beliefs. And a prerequisite for seeking knowledge in reality is learning the Arabic language. Al-
Islām is a religion which was revealed in Arabic to an Arab people, thus whoever wants to fully understand its sources and evidences must learn the Arabic language to be able to do so.

Another aspect of seeking knowledge is surrounding ones-self with circumstances that enables and encourages the person to seek knowledge. Included in this is:

- Befriending the righteous, scholars, and students of knowledge.
- Keeping away from sinners, sin and places where sins are committed.
- Adhering to the *Jamā’ah* and spending time with Muslim brothers.
- Acknowledging your defiency in fulfilling the rights of Allāh.
- Acknowledging your need for Islamic knowledge, and good deeds.
- Acknowledging and realizing that Allāh is with the *Jamā’ah* and not those who separate from it, or seeks to divide it with debate and discussion.

There is no doubt that these things help in reviving the heart and increasing the desire for seeking knowledge.

Many people today make the grave mistake that when they learn issues about Tawhīd and its pillars and conditions, they think they have learned enough and they stop in their
tracks without improving. Thus you find them ten years after having learned these issues, completely in the same condition, or even worse. No memorization of the Qurān, no new
issues learned in the religion and no increased amount of worship. And this is the trap of Shaytān which he – may the curse of Allāh be upon him – wants the Muslim to fall in.
Because whoever does not improve in the religion, then he is more than likely to end up in a worse state than when he started, which the honest person easily can testify to.

Other people learn a few issues in the religion and immediately run out to debate everybody and everyone, causing them to fall in many mistakes without realizing;
especially speaking about the religion without knowledge which is among the biggest of sins that a person can perform.

So the slave must acknowledge his lowly state in front of Allāh, attain *ikhlās* (sincerity) and then humbleness, humbleness, humbleness.

The seeker of knowledge must always abide by the principles and the limits of the *Salaf*. So if he reads from the latecomers then he should not rely solely upon their words without
referring the issues back the *Salaf* and their *manhaj.* So he should not accept any disagreement or opinion that exceeds the words of the *Salaf*. Nor should he consider from
*Ahlus-Sunnah* those who have innovations in their religion, he should not ask for mercy for them, or consider their opinions to be valid.

So whoever believes in what has been stated in this book, and he adheres to the principles of the *Salaf* in the religion, then Allāh has verily guided him to much good. The reader is advised to submit himself, both his soul and his body, to what came from Allāh and His Messenger (ﷺ) and not to be pleased with anything that opposes any of this, no matter who it might come from. We are obliged to worship Allāh following the Qurān and the *Sunnah* according to the understanding of the *Salaf*. Upon this the
Muslims will achieve unity in *dunyā*, and based upon this – without the slightest doubt – they will be judged in the *ākhirah*. So good news to the one who rectifies his *‘aqīdah* before death approaches him and his deeds will be cut off. We ask Allāh for a beautiful ending.

Glorified is Allāh and all praise is due to Him. We bear witness that no-one is worthy except Allāh Alone Who has no partner, we ask Him for forgiveness and we turn to Him in repentance.

And may the peace and abundant blessings of Allāh be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and whoever followed them in goodness until the Day of Judgment. *Allāhumma āmīn*.
